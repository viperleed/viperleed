# ViPErLEED Hardware schematics

This folder contains the most recent schematics in pdf format, including the PCB layout.
The source files used to generate the schematics (as well as previous versions) can be found in './source', while the data sheets of the most relevant components are stored in './datasheets'.

**'...basic_configuration.pdf'**: Schematics for a simple configuration that does not use a relay to allow switching the I<sub>0</sub> range between 0-2.5V and 0-10V. The switch can still be done manually by jumpering some of the pins, as schematically represented in '...jumpers.pdf'
