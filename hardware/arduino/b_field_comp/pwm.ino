/**
Quick Start Guide to Timer/Counter4
===================================
This section is intended as a concise introduction to the PWM waveform
generation using the Timer/Counter4, subsequently abbreviated as TC4.

TC4 can be used in 8-bit or 10-bit operation, depending on whether the user 
also programs the two high bits inside shared register TC4H (cf. datasheet 
sec. 15.2.2). For example, in order to perform the 10-bit write 0x31F to 
register TC4H:OCR4C, first program TC4H with 0x3, then write 0x1F to OCR4C.

TC4 contains three independant Output Compare Units A/B/D which constantly
compare their register values OCR4A/B/D with monotonically increasing or
decreasing Counter register TCNT4. If a match occurs, Output Compare pins
OC4A/B/D will be set or cleared depending on the Compare Output Mode settings 
COM4x1:0, where x = Output Compare Unit A/B/D. COM4x1:0 can thus be used to 
invert the  PWM signal, see 'set_pwm_polarity'. Also, the COM4x1:0 bits control 
the connection to the inverted/non-inverted Output Compare pins /OC4x vs OC4x.

While registers OCR4A/B/D are used to control the PWM duty cycle, OCR4C is used
to set the PWM base frequency, and implicitly also the PWM resolution. The 
relevant formulae are also given in the datasheet sec. 15.8. For TC4 operated
in Fast PWM Mode the PWM frequency, TC4 clock frequency and PWM resolution are
determined as follows:

(1)   f_PWM = f_clk_T4 / (OCR4C + 1)

(2)   f_clk_T4 = F_CPU_CLK / TC4_prescaler

(3)   res_PWM = log2(OCR4C + 1) = log2(f_clk_T4 / f_PWM)

Every time TCNT4 has a match with OCR4C, TCNT4 is reset to zero and begins to
count up or down again until another match occurs. The TC4 frequency 'f_clk_T4'
is derived from the CPU clock 'F_CPU_CLK' divided by the TC4 prescaler settings
CS43:40 contained in register TCCR4B. Equation (3) shows that the user may want 
to stay as close to the maximum value of OCR4C as possible, in order to achieve 
the highest possible PWM resolution. Therefore, 'set_pwm_frequency' will first
determine the TC4 prescaler value which will allow for the highest possible
10-bit value inside TC4H:OCR4C which in turn will provide the best possible PWM
resolution. If a value smaller than three is written to OCR4C, the hardware will
replace that value with three in order to prevent too high a PWM frequency.

The ATmega32U4 includes the following Timer/Counter modules:
- 8-bit Timer/Counter0
- 16-bit Timers/Counters (TC1 and TC3)
- 10-bit High Speed Timer/Counter4

In contrast to the other TC modules, TC4 can be operated with up to 64 MHz if
the supply voltage is higher than 4V. The firmware does not make use of this 
feature.

Note: The 11-bit Enhanced PWM Mode is not working up to some chip revision.

        Notice that the resolution of the PWM (i.e., of the average current)

        three available Timer/Counter4 channels A, B and D.
