// Acceptable messages for communication with the PC

#define PC_CONFIGURATION     63  // PC requested hardware configuration (ASCII '?')

#define PC_SET_UP_ADCS       83  // PC requested to prepare the ADCs for a measurement (ASCII 'S')   // TODO: The python side will have to keep track of when the last calibration was done, and warn if it is too old.
