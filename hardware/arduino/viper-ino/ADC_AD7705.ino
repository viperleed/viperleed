    /**Set the gain and trigger an AD7705 ADC.

    This essentially sets a well-defined point in time after
    which conversions of the selected input channel will be
    available, after amplification with the selected gain.
    
    Notice that this function does not initiate the reading
    of any of the conversion results from the Arduino. Thus,
    every 1/updateRate sec after this, new values will be
    available in the data register, and they will be thrown
    away if they are not read.
    
    The function also sets bipolar unbuffered operation mode,
    as well as 'normal operation' (i.e., not a calibration)
    that is necessary for our inputs. Any old data that may
    still be present in the data register is also discarded.

    Parameters
    ----------
    chipSelectPin : byte
        The Arduino pin that corresponds to the ADC that has to
        be addressed
    channel : byte, {0, 1}
        Which of the input channels will be used for conversion
    gain : byte, {0...7}
        Which gain value should be used. The input is amplified
        by a factor 2**gain.

    Thereafter, one has to wait until self-calibration is
    done, by calling AD7705waitForCalibration, or by waiting
    for the first data (AD7705waitAndReadData).
    
    Triggering (STATE_TRIGGER_ADCS) during self-calibration
    should never be performed.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    chipSelectPin : byte
        The Arduino pin corresponding to the ADC
        that needs to be calibrated.
    channel : byte, {0, 1}
        Which of the input channels needs to be
        calibrated.  Only this channel will be
        calibrated. The calibration of the other
        channel remains untouched.
    gain : byte, {0...7}
        Which gain should be used for calibration.
        The signal will be amplified by a factor
        2**gain before conversion.  A gain switch
        always requires a new calibration.
    updateRate : {AD7705_50HZ, AD7705_60HZ, AD7705_500HZ}
        The input conversion rate for which calibration
        needs to be done. When changing updateRate, the
        ADC always needs a new calibration.
