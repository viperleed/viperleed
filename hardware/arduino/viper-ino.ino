#define WORKINPROGRESS     7   //Python script will decide which pin !!!!!!!!!!! this needs to be NOT a #define because it needs updating. It should be a byte. Also, probably good to give it a more descriptive name, like, whatToMeasure. with 8 bits, we can have a bit representation of the devices. E.g.: ADC0 if WORKINPROGRESS == 0x01 == 0b00000001, ADC1 if WORKINPROGRESS == 0x02 == 0b00000010, LM35 if WORKINPROGRESS == 0x04 == 0b00000100. And combinations can be obtained by bitwise OR. In principle we could also encode it better, such that this single byte can be used also to determine which channel of which ADC to measure: e.g.: MEASURE_ADC0_CH0 = 0x01, MEASURE_ADC0_CH1 = 0x02, MEASURE_ADC1_CH0 = 0x04, MEASURE_ADC1_CH1 = 0x08, MEASURE_LM35 = 0x0f. Obviously then one needs to handle somehow the cases in which the python asks for measuring two channels of the same ADC, which cannot be done at the same time.
