> This is Ulrike Diebold from the Institute of Applied Physics at the

> To this end, we are designing a software package around the TensErLEED

> The TensErLEED does not incorporate phase shift calculations for

> (EEASiSSS) program.
> Could you be so kind to provide us with the latest version of the

> 
> We are also planning to release our tool to the community in an
> integrated form with the latest TensErLEED version, with the aim of
> providing a self-contained, portable freeware package for LEED-IV.
> Ideally, we would then also like to include your EEASiSSS software
> in this package.

> If you agree to this, we would of course fully credit you as the
