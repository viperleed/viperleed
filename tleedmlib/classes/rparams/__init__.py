This package is a result of the refactor of the rparams.py
module, originally by @fkraushofer. Contains definition of
Rparams, the class containing most of the information during
a viperleed.tleedm run. It also defines specific classes for
not-so-simple user parameters (in package special), used as
attributes of Rparams. Defaults for the simple parameters are
defined in module _defaults. Their variability limits in module
_limits. Special parameters define their own defaults and limits.
