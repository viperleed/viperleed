"""Package special of viperleed.tleedmlib.classes.rparams.

@author: Michele Riva (@michele-riva)

This package defines classes for not-so-easy parameters to be used
as attributes for an Rparams object. These are, for example:
- parameters that would otherwise need to have variable types and
  require a bunch of isinstance checks when used
- parameters that have peculiar structure
- parameters that have multiple values that are cleaner when stored
  as attributes
- parameters that have a non-so-simple conversion to/from string
  or Assignment, i.e., those for which a ParameterInterpreter
  interpret_<...> method would be very complex.
