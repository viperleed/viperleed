"""
Module beamgen of viperleed.tleedmlib.

Creates the BEAMLIST file for TensErLEED calculations.

@author: Alexander Imre
@author: Florian Kraushofer

Original version by Florian Kraushofer (2020) was a wrapper for the fortran
beamgen script by Uli LÃ¶ffler et al. Complete refactor by Alexander Imre (2023)
that removes the dependency on the fortran script and instead accomplishes the
same in python. This is more flexible and allows for more accurate calculations.

    """Calculates and writes the contents for the file BEAMLIST.

    BEAMLIST contains a list of all diffraction beams that will be used 
    for internal calculations (as opposed to IVBEAMS, which contains the
    beams to be output). The file list the beams with indices as float
    values and a lower cutoff energy below which the beam is evanescent
    (i.e. does not leave the surface and has intensity 0). The used 
    format is defined in make_beamlist_string and dictated by TensErLEED
    and the legacy beamgen scripts that were used before. Note that
    BEAMLIST is not read directly by refcalc, but instead all input
    files for the refcalc are combined into one string (by collectFIN in
    iorefcalc.py) and then piped in.

    NB: The energies calculated here are slightly higher than the values
    from beamgenv3 (and beamgen.v1.7) because we use *more accurate*
    values for unit conversions.The legacy code used these rounded
    values:
    HARTREE_TO_EV = 27.21
    BOHR_TO_ANGSTROM = 0.529
    Similarly, the list of included beams may be different for the same 
    energy range, as the legacy code used rounded values and typecast a
    cutoff from float to int.

    In any case, this version should give more accurate energy values 
    and be more generous in how many beams are considered.

def get_beam_scattering_subsets(beam_indices_raw):
    """Takes a list of beam_indices and returns the beam scattering
    subsets and reduced indices for sorting.

    LEED diffraction beams are grouped into subsets for the computation
    of reflection/transmission matrices. In the full dynamic scattering
    calculation (refcalc), one needs to consider that one beam can be
    scattered into another. However, this is only possible, if the
    beam wave-vectors are related by the *bulk* unit cell. I.e. a beam
    (1/2,0) can be scattered into (3/2,0), but not into (1,0).
    This property can be used in the refcalc, to simplify calculations
    by making the reflection/transmission matrices block-diagonal.
    To enable this, we need to group the beams accordingly in BEAMLIST.

    This function takes a list of beams (as BeamIndex objects) and
    calculates reduced indices via h_red = h%1, k_red = k%1 (wrapping
    the beams back in the first Brillouin zone). It then takes a set
    of the reduced indices, to generate unique identifiers of the
    subsets. The first (and possibly only) subset contains, by
    definition, the integer beams, starting with (0|0).

    Parameters
    ----------
    beam_indices_raw : list(BeamIndex)
        List of beam indices.

    Returns
    -------
    subset_classes : list
        A tuple containing the unique first Brillouin zone beam indices
        for the beam subsets. The length gives the number of subsets.
    reduced_indices : list
        A list of corresponding reduced indices for beam indices_raw.
