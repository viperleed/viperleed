Utilities
---------

ViPErLEED includes several additional utilities for file processing and organization.
These are installed as part of the Python package, and can be called from the command line via ``viperleed poscar`` or ``viperleed util`` followed by the utility name.

- :ref:`POSCAR utilities<poscar_utils>`: A set of utilities for quick POSCAR manipulation. Examples include deleting parts of cell, structure symmetry detection or setting flags for use with :term:`DFT` software. These are called via ``viperleed poscar`` followed by the utility name.
- :ref:`rearrange_phaseshifts<rearrange_phaseshifts>`: A simple utility for taking an existing :ref:`PHASESHIFTS file<phaseshifts>` and duplicating and/or re-arranging blocks.
- :ref:`AUXEXPBEAMS_TO_EXPBEAMS<aux_to_exp>`: Transforms :ref:`AUXEXPBEAMS<AUXEXPBEAMS>`  format files (input for TensErLEED) to :ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv<EXPBEAMS>`  format.

.. tip:: 
    If you find yourself using a utility frequently, you can add an alias to your ``.bashrc`` file.


.. seealso::
   :ref:`Bookkeeper<bookkeeper>`: A helper utility built into viperleed calc that sorts files from previous runs into a "history" folder, and keeps track in the history.info file.
