BULK_LIKE_BELOW
===============

BULK_LIKE_BELOW is a helper parameter that can be used to automatically determine :ref:`BULK_REPEAT<BULK_REPEAT>`, :ref:`N_BULK_LAYERS<BLAY>`  and :ref:`LAYER_CUTS<CTRUNC>`. It specifies a fraction of **c** in the :ref:`POSCAR<POSCAR>`  unit cell below which the structure is bulk-like, i.e. unrelaxed (if coming from DFT), or sufficiently close to unrelaxed to fall within :ref:`SYMMETRY_EPS<SYMPREC>`. Generally, this is the most easy way to detect and define the bulk if at least two unrelaxed bulk repeat units are present in the :ref:`POSCAR<POSCAR>`  file. BULK_LIKE_BELOW does not need to be specified if the bulk is manually defined through :ref:`N_BULK_LAYERS<BLAY>`, :ref:`LAYER_CUTS<CTRUNC>`, and :ref:`BULK_REPEAT<BULK_REPEAT>`.

**Default:** No default, no auto-detection of bulk if undefined

**Allowed values:** positive float between 0 and 1

**Syntax:**

::

   BULK_LIKE_BELOW = 0.22

BULK_LIKE_BELOW will only be used once during initialization, then automatically commented out in PARAMETERS for future runs. Instead, the automatically detected :ref:`N_BULK_LAYERS<BLAY>`, :ref:`LAYER_CUTS<CTRUNC>`, and :ref:`BULK_REPEAT<BULK_REPEAT>`  will be written into the PARAMETERS file explicitly. This ensures stability of the bulk definition in case some of the layers that are initially bulk-like are then varied during optimization.

The bulk unit cell is detected by taking only the slab below BULK_LIKE_BELOW and finding the smallest translation vector (towards vacuum) with a **c** component that preserves the structure. Only translation vectors with **z** components of less than or equal to the thickness of the slab below BULK_LIKE_BELOW are considered. The minimal such translation vector is by definition the minimal :ref:`BULK_REPEAT<BULK_REPEAT>`  vector. By default, :ref:`N_BULK_LAYERS<BLAY>`  is 1, but if a further cut with layer spacing of at least 1.2 Ã… is possible within the bulk repeat unit, then :ref:`N_BULK_LAYERS<BLAY>`  will be chosen as 2 and :ref:`LAYER_CUTS<CTRUNC>`  will be set accordingly.

Note that for the automatic detection to work, the bulk structure has to repeat at least once below BULK_LIKE_BELOW. If there are not enough unrelaxed layers, you can try to choose BULK_LIKE_BELOW more liberally and increase :ref:`SYMMETRY_EPS<SYMPREC>`  to still detect the bulk repeat unit automatically. However, be aware that the numerical precision of the detected :ref:`BULK_REPEAT<BULK_REPEAT>`  vector is then limited by the relaxations of your structure, and may need to be corrected manually.

If :ref:`BULK_REPEAT<BULK_REPEAT>`  is already defined, BULK_LIKE_BELOW will be *ignored* (with a warning).
