FILAMENT_WF
===========

FILAMENT_WF defines the workfunction of the emitting cathode (in eV).
This number will be added to the electron energy when calculating the muffin-tin potentials.

**Default**: FILAMENT_WF = 2.65 (LaB6)

**Syntax**:

::

   FILAMENT_WF = LaB6
   FILAMENT_WF = W
   FILAMENT_WF = <wf>

**Acceptable**: a single floating-point number (``<wf>`` above). Also the special keys LaB6 (2.65 eV) and W (4.5 eV) are allowed.

**Note**: An erroneous setting of this parameter is not critical since the search/R-factor algorithm will anyway allow a relative shift of the calculated I(V) curves with respect to the experimental ones to find the best match. However, this can also be used as a cross-check at the end of the search: If the the filament workfunction is set correctly, any significant IV energy shift in the fit will indicate that something is wrong.
