BEAM_INCIDENCE
==============

BEAM_INCIDENCE defines the incidence angles (in degrees) of the electron beam on the surface.
The polar angle ``theta`` is measured from the surface normal, the azimuthal angle ``phi`` is positive counterclockwise when looking at the solid from vacuum, with ``phi=0`` **corresponding to the positive x axis**, as defined in the :ref:`POSCAR<POSCAR>` file.
See also the diagram shown in :numref:`fig_theta_and_phi`.
ViPErLEED considers the incident wave vector to be in direction from the electron gun towards the surface, i.e. 

.. math::
   \vec{k} = |\vec{k}|(-\cos(\phi)\sin(\theta)\hat{u}_x - \sin(\phi)\sin(\theta)\hat{u}_y - \cos(\theta) \hat{u}_z) .



**Default**: BEAM_INCIDENCE = THETA 0, PHI 0

**Syntax**:

::

   BEAM_INCIDENCE = THETA 0.3, PHI 10.1
   BEAM_INCIDENCE = 0.3 10.1

**Acceptable values**: -90 :math:`\leq` ``theta`` :math:`\leq` 90, 0 :math:`\leq` ``phi`` < 360. All numbers are considered floats. Negative values for ``theta`` will internally be corrected to positive by adding or subtracting 180° from ``phi``.

``theta`` and ``phi`` represent tilt and azimuthal angles, respectively, in degrees.
Notice that if the flags THETA and PHI are not specified, only the first two floats are considered:
the first is taken as the tilt angle theta, the second as the azimuth phi.

.. hint::
   -  In general, unless the experiment was performed at large off-normal incidence (>2°), keeping the default value should lead to the correct optimized geometry, but the R factor will be worse than for an experiment at normal incidence. In case the incidence angle is significantly off, one needs to measure a simple system (clean, unreconstructed metal) with the same experimental settings, to determine first the correct angle of incidence to be used for more complicated situations.
   -  Beam incidence optimization is commonly one of the last refinement steps of the LEED fit.
   -  Even for normal incidence, during the last polishing one can even use a purposely off-normal BEAM_INCIDENCE (``theta`` different from zero) and average the resulting almost-equivalent beams in order to account for the fact that the electron beam has a finite aperture angle. (For averaging, see the :ref:`AVERAGE_BEAMS<AVERAGEBEAMS>`  parameter). This commonly leads to ``theta`` values in the order of 0.3 -- 0.5°. This option makes sense only if the R factor is very low and the surface has sufficiently high symmetry (at least threefold rotation symmetry or mirror/glide planes in two directions), so that averaging simulates incoming beams from several azimuthal directions. The azimuth ``phi`` of the incoming beam should be chosen such that it is midway between the azimuth values of two beams that are symmetry-equivalent at normal incidence.
