PHASESHIFT_EPS
==============

PHASESHIFT_EPS defines a cutoff criterion to determine the maximum angular momentum number (LMAX=MLMAX in Fortran) to be used in the spherical harmonics expansion, used for calculating the scattering matrices within each layer.

**Default**: 0.01

**Syntax**:

::

   PHASESHIFT_EPS = 0.03
   PHASESHIFT_EPS = r

**Acceptable values**: 0<``PHASESHIFT_EPS``\ <1, float, **OR** flags **R**\ ough (0.1) / **N**\ ormal (0.05) / **F**\ ine (0.01) / **E**\ xtrafine (0.001) (only first letter of flags is read, case-insensitive). Typical 0.001 to 0.1

LMAX may further be limited by the :ref:`LMAX<LMAX>` parameter, which can be used to define upper and lower bounds for acceptable LMAX, or also to fix LMAX to a specific value (in the latter case, PHASESHIFT_EPS is ignored).
By default, LMAX is allowed to vary between 6 and 18.
