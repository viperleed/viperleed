THEO_ENERGIES
=============

THEO_ENERGIES can be defined to set the electron energy range on which the
reference calculation, as well as the search algorithm will be performed.

**Default**: if no experimental data file is available,
THEO_ENERGIES = 20 800 3, otherwise THEO_ENERGIES = ``Efrom`` ``Eto`` 3,
with ``Efrom`` = min(exp. energy)-3 and ``Eto``\ =max(exp. energy)+3

**Syntax:**

::

   THEO_ENERGIES = 20 600 3
   THEO_ENERGIES = 50
   THEO_ENERGIES = _ _ 2   ! get Efrom and Eto from experimental data, but use step 2 eV

**Acceptable values:** Three positive floats for explicit definition, OR one
float to calculate only one energy, OR use underscores to leave some values
but not others at default (e.g. to be defined by experimental beams).

Notice that, generally, it is a good idea to choose the start and end energies
such that the theoretical calculation interval is a few eV larger than the
experimental energy range. During the determination of the |R factor|\ s, as
well as in the search of the best structure, the theoretical spectra will be
shifted a bit along the energy axis to find the best match with experiment
(see :ref:`IV_SHIFT_RANGE<IVSHIFTRANGE>` to control this shift).

If ``Eto-Efrom`` is not an integer multiple of ``Estep``, ``Efrom`` will 
be modified to a slightly lower energy such that this is the case.

**TODO**: perhaps we should have the default in case EXPBEAMS is there: look at
the IV_SHIFT_RANGE to decide how much to 'expand' the THEO_ENERGIES rather than
having a fixed 3Â eV expansion on both sides? (Should probably be slightly 
more than IV_SHIFT_RANGE since interpolation is rather bad at the ends. -ms)
