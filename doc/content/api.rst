====================
ViPErLEED Python API
====================

A core part of the :ref:`ViPErLEED project<index>` is the |calc|
Python package. (See :ref:`here<installation>` for installation instructions.)
While |calc| can be used as a standalone tool to perform |LEED-IV|
calculations, it also contains a number of useful library functions related 
to surface science and electron diffraction. Through the :term:`API`, users can 
access all of the functionality of |calc| from within their own Python programs.

To use the API, you can simply import the ``viperleed`` package and call
the desired functions. Here is a simple example of how to use the API to 
find the plane group of a slab from a :ref:`POSCAR file<poscar>`:

.. code-block:: python

    from viperleed.calc import symmetry
    from viperleed.calc.classes.rparams import Rparams
    from viperleed.calc.files.poscar import readPOSCAR

    # Load a slab from a POSCAR file
    example_slab = readPOSCAR('POSCAR')

    # create an empty parameters object and run the full update
    run_params = Rparams()
    example_slab.fullUpdate(run_params)

    # detect the plane group of the slab and print it
    planegroup = symmetry.findSymmetry(example_slab, run_params)
    print(planegroup)
