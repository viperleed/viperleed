refcalc-FIN
===========

Contains the input for the TensErLEED reference calculation.
Simply a collection of the data in :ref:`AUXLATGEO<AUXLATGEO>`,
:ref:`BEAMLIST<BEAMLIST>`, :ref:`AUXNONSTRUCT<AUXNONSTRUCT>`,
:ref:`PHASESHIFTS<PHASESHIFTS>`, :ref:`AUXBEAMS<AUXBEAMS>` and
:ref:`AUXGEO<AUXGEO>`.

The refcalc-FIN file does not have to be in the folder for the reference
calculation to run, but rather is piped directly into TensErLEED from |calc|.
