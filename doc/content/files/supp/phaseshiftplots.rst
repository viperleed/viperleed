Phaseshifts-plots.pdf
=====================

The Phaseshifts-plots.pdf file is generated during the initialization, and serves purely for information. It displays the phaseshifts that occur when an electron of a given energy and angular momentum number *L* scatters at an atom in a given site. One plot is generated for each site and element that can occupy that site. The data is displayed exactly as found in the :ref:`PHASESHIFTS<phaseshifts>` file, without any processing.

The order of the plots is the same as in the :ref:`PHASESHIFTS<phaseshifts>` files, and reflects the order that tleedm expects to find for the elements and/or sites.
If you supplied :ref:`PHASESHIFTS<phaseshifts>` manually, instead of generating them automatically, make sure that the phaseshifts have been correctly assigned to their given elements/sites.
