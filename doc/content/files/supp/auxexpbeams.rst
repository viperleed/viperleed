The AUXEXPBEAMS file
====================

The AUXEXPBEAMS file contains the experimental data (beam intensities
vs. energy) to be compared against, formatted as input for TensErLEED. 
Generated from an :ref:`EXPBEAMS<EXPBEAMS>`  file before the search is 
run.

For backwards compatibility, old experimental beam files formatted as 
AUXEXPBEAMS can easily be transformed to the :ref:`EXPBEAMS<EXPBEAMS>` 
file format with the :ref:`AUXEXPBEAMS_to_EXPBEAMS utility<aux_to_exp>`.
