Files refcalc-fd.out and refcalc-amp.out
========================================

TensErLEED writes the output of the :ref:`ref-calc` for each energy step, i.e. the diffraction
intensity :math:`I` and complex amplitude :math:`A` of each requested 
beam (index :math:`(h|k)`) at energyc:math:`E` to two files called ``fd.out`` 
and ``amp.out``.

In a first step, ViPErLEED takes these outputs and combines them in the files
``refcalc-fd.out`` and ``refcalc-amp.out``.
These files thus contain the raw, unformatted output of the reference calculation.
They are provided primarily for compatibility and debugging purposes.

The same data is provided in a more readable and useful format in the 
:ref:`THEOBEAMS.csv<THEOBEAMS>` file.
