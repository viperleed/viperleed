File R_OUT
==========

``R_OUT`` is a file created during the :ref:`R-factor calculation<r-factor_calculation>`
in :term:`TensErLEED`. It contains the R-factors between the input :math:`I(V)` data 
(:ref:`file EXPBEAMS<EXPBEAMS>`)
and theory calculation for each beam and each requested value of the 
real part of the inner potential :math:`V_{0r}`.

:math:`V_{0r}` effectively shifts experiment and theory :math:`I(V)` curves
against each other on the energy axis and needs to be optimized along with
structural parameters to find a best fit structure. In TensErLEED this is
generally performed by brute force over a grid, i.e. by calculating the 
R-factors for each step on the requested :math:`V_{0r}` grid. See the parameter
:ref:`IV_SHIFT_RANGE<IVSHIFTRANGE>` for details.

The contents of ``R_OUT`` are read by tleedm to extract the R-factors.
