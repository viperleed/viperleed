SD.TL
=====

The file ``SD.TL`` is the search output file generated by TensErLEED and is
read repeatedly by |calc| during the structure search to extract information
on the progress of the search. It contains the the current and previous state
of all individuals in the search population and is periodically updated (see
parameter :ref:`SEARCH_POPULATION<searchpop>`). The name ``SD.TL`` is used by
convention and defined in the ``search-PARAM`` file.

TensErLEED appends information about the current last search generation to the
file at predefined intervals. For every individual in the search population,
``SD.TL`` lists the current parameter-indices, best-fit real part of the inner
potential and the corresponding R-factor.
