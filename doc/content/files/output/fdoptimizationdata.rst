The FD_Optimization.pdf and FD_Optimization.csv files
=====================================================

The FD_Optimization files contain R-factors as a function of the 
parameter under variation during a 
:ref:`full-dynamic optimization<Fdoptimization>`.
The FD_Optimization.csv file contains two columns with values of the 
parameter under variation, and the corresponding R-factor, respectively.
FD_Optimization.pdf shows a scatter plot of these data points, together 
with a parabola fit to the data. The coordinates of the parabola minimum
(parameter value and corresponding predicted R-factor) are also printed 
into the FD_Optimization.pdf plot.
