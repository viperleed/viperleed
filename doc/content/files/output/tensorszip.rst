The Tensors
===========

Tensors generated by the reference calculation are given a a generic name of format 'T\_\ *N*', where *N* is the number of the atom (same numbering as in :ref:`POSCAR<POSCAR>`).

The resulting files contain the tensor quantities :math:`T^{ref}_{i;l,m;l',m'}` (see :ref:`tensor leed approximation<tensor_leed>`) and refercence amplitudes.
These Tensor files are then collected in a directory Tensors\_\ *XYZ*, where *XYZ* is the 'Tensor index', a running number which is incremented by one every time a reference calculation is executed. 
Finally, the input files relevant for generating these Tensor files are added to the Tensors\_\ *XYZ* directory: :ref:`PARAMETERS<PARAMETERS>`, :ref:`POSCAR<POSCAR>`, :ref:`VIBROCC<VIBOCCIN>`, :ref:`IVBEAMS<IVBEAMS>`  and :ref:`_PHASESHIFTS<PHASESHIFTS>`. 
When the calculation finishes, the directory Tensors\_\ *XYZ* is packed into an archive Tensors\_\ *XYZ*.zip, which is moved into the 'Tensors' directory.

In delta-amplitudes calculations, the Tensors with the highest index will be used by default. 
The :ref:`TENSOR_INDEX<TENSOR_INDEX>`  parameter allows specifying that an older set of Tensors should be used instead.
