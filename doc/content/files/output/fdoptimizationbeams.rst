The FD_Optimization_beams.pdf file
==================================

The FD_Optimization_beams.pdf file plots I(V) curves obtained from 
r-factor calculations during :ref:`full-dynamic optimization<Fdoptimization>`. 
I(V) curves are drawn for every beam, showing theoretical curves at 
every data point tested during optimization, as well as the experimental 
data.

The file format is generally equivalent to the one of the 
:ref:`Rfactor_plots.pdf<Rfactorplots>`  files. Appearance of the I(V) 
plots can be modified with the :ref:`PLOT_IV<PLOT_COLORS_RFACTOR>` 
parameter. R-factors are between the *best* theoretical dataset 
(marked by the larger line width) and the experimental data.
