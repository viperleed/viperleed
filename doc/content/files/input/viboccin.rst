VIBROCC
=======

The VIBROCC file lists the starting guesses for vibrational amplitudes 
(in ångstrom) and site occupations. The minimum input is a vibrational 
amplitude for each element in the :ref:`POSCAR file<POSCAR>`. If the 
:ref:`ELEMENT_MIX<ELSPLIT>`  parameter is defined for an element in the 
:ref:`PARAMETERS file<PARAMETERS>`, explicitly assigning vibrational 
amplitudes and occupations to all sub-elements is recommended.
See also :ref:`this page<occdelta>` for instructions on how to vary the
occupation of a site during structure optimization.

Additionally, the VIBROCC file can contain a block defining offsets in 
vibrational amplitudes, occupation, or position per element for specific 
sites.

A VIBROCC file containing only some starting guesses for vibrational 
amplitudes can be generated automatically using the :ref:`VIBR_AMP_SCALE`, 
:ref:`T_EXPERIMENT` and :ref:`T_DEBYE` parameters in the 
:ref:`PARAMETERS<PARAMETERS>` file. See :ref:`below<vibrocc_auto>` for details.

Example
-------

**PARAMETERS file**

::

  ELEMENT_MIX M = Fe Ni
  SITE_DEF O = surf top(2)
  SITE_DEF M = surf top(2)

**VIBROCC file**

::

   = Vibrational Amplitudes
   M_def = Fe 0.1, Ni 0.1
   M_surf = Fe 0.125, Ni 0.12          !some comment
   O_def = 0.19
   O_surf = 0.18

   = Occupations
   M* = Fe 0.8, Ni 0.2
   O_surf = 0.95

   = Search offsets
   POS 4 = Fe 0.0 0.0 0.01, Ni 0.0 0.0 -0.01     ! PFe_def
   OCC 4 = Fe 0.01, Ni -0.01     ! PFe_def

The two main blocks in the VIBROCC files are 'Vibrational Amplitudes' 
and 'Occupations'. Lines starting with '=' indicate the start of a 
block.

Vibrational amplitudes and occupations
--------------------------------------

In each block, properties can be defined for each site type (left-hand side of '='). 
The site types are labelled as ``El_sitename``, where ``El`` is an element as found in 
the :ref:`POSCAR file<POSCAR>`, and ``sitename`` is a site name defined in the 
:ref:`PARAMETERS file<PARAMETERS>`  under :ref:`SITE_DEF<SITEDEF>`. By default, an 
asterisk (``*``) is interpreted as a wildcard character, so ``O*`` will access both ``O_top`` and ``O_def``.

If required, the left-hand parameters can also be interpreted fully as regular expressions 
(see also: `python re syntax <https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/re.html>`__ and 
`python re HOWTO <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/regex.html>`__). This feature is turned 
off by default to avoid unintentional issues with e.g. full stops in site names (not recommended!), 
but can be turned on by inserting a line ``= regex on`` at any point in the VIBROCC file, and 
disabled later by the line ``= regex off``. Note that if regular expressions is on, the 
asterisk ``*`` will *not* be a wildcard character any more (the equivalent would be ``.*``)!

On the right-hand side of the '=' sign, you can either give only one value, or give multiple 
values for different elements. Here, the elements are either the ones found in the :ref:`POSCAR file<POSCAR>`, 
or the ones defined in :ref:`ELEMENT_MIX<ELSPLIT>`. If element names in the POSCAR file and in 
ELEMENT_MIX overlap, the assignment will nevertheless be made only for the chemical element, see 
:ref:`element name collision<ElementNameCollision>`. If only one value is given in the 
``Vibrational Amplitudes`` block, the vibrational amplitudes for all elements in this site will be set 
to this value. If only one value is given in the ``Occupations`` block, this value will be set for the 
main site element (e.g. O for the O_top site), or for all main elements in a site affected by 
:ref:`ELEMENT_MIX<ELSPLIT>`. The occupations for all other elements will be set to zero for this site.

Total occupation in a site can be smaller than one, which will be interpreted as the rest being vacancies. 
Defining an occupation greater than one will throw a warning and may halt execution; if execution proceeds, 
the occupation will be re-scaled to 1.

For simple systems, the ``Occupations`` block need not contain values for elements with 100% site 
occupation, and can even be left out entirely. The default value is 1.0 for the site's main element and 
0.0 for all other elements. If the site is affected by :ref:`ELEMENT_MIX<ELSPLIT>`, the occupation 
will be evenly split between the sub-elements defined in :ref:`ELEMENT_MIX<ELSPLIT>`. A simple example 
with 100% occupations and no :ref:`ELEMENT_MIX<ELSPLIT>`  might therefore look like this:

::

   = Vibrational Amplitudes
   Fe_def = 0.10
   Fe_surf = 0.18
   O_def = 0.19
   O_surf = 0.18

Search offsets
--------------

Apart from starting values for vibrational amplitudes and occupations, the VIBROCC file can contain an additional block called "search offsets". This can be used to, *for a specific atom*, define positional, vibrational, or occupational offsets from the site's values. This has two use cases:

-  If a parameter, e.g. the vibrational amplitude, is varied independently for the different atoms sharing a site type, the search result will likely yield different values for these atoms. These values will be written to the VIBROCC_OUT file to intialize a potential continuation job with the exact results from the previous search, instead of an average.
-  If there are multiple elements sharing a site via :ref:`ELEMENT_MIX<ELSPLIT>`, the positions of the different chemical species may be different depending on the element. This cannot be mapped in the POSCAR file or the reference calculation of :term:`TensErLEED`, but can be mapped to the calculation via the search offsets block, by defining different values for different elements in the site.

**Example:**

::

   = Search offsets
   POS 4 = Fe 0.0 0.0 0.01, Ni 0.0 0.0 -0.01   ! for atom number 4, displace iron atoms by 0.01 A away from the bulk and Ni atoms 0.01 A towards the bulk.
   OCC 4 = Fe 0.01, Ni -0.01                   ! for atom number four, there is 1% more iron and 1% less nickel than defined for the site type

The syntax for this block differs somewhat from the vibrational amplitudes and occupations. On the left-hand side, each line is expected to contain:

-  A flag ``POS`` / ``VIB`` / ``OCC`` defining what type of parameter should be modified
-  An atom number (corresponding to the number in the POSCAR file)

On the right-hand side, the syntax is similar to the vibrational amplitudes and displacements blocks. For vibrational amplitudes or occupations, one value per element is expected, while for position offsets, three values per element are expected. The three values for geometry are cartesian x, y and z offsets, in ångströms, where positive z means away from the surface.

.. _vibrocc_out:

VIBROCC_OUT
-----------

After executing a search, a VIBROCC_OUT file will be produced in the OUT
folder. This takes the same format as the original VIBROCC file, and 
the new vibrational amplitudes and occupations are those of the 
best-fit structure found during the search (i.e. the one with the 
lowest R-factor). If atoms in the same site were allowed to vary 
independently, the vibrations and occupations written for each site 
will be the average, and values for the single atoms will be written as 
search offsets.

Automatic generation of VIBROCC
-------------------------------

ViPErLEED can automatically generate a VIBROCC file containing starting guesses
for vibrational amplitudes.
To do this, the experiment temperature :math:`T` (:ref:`T_EXPERIMENT`) and the
sample Debye temperature :math:`\Theta_D` (:ref:`T_DEBYE`) must be specified in
:ref:`PARAMETERS<PARAMETERS>`.
Additionally, :ref:`VIBR_AMP_SCALE` must be set if you are using non-default
sites (which is generally recommended).

Given these parameters and the atomic masses :math:`m`, we can estimate the
atomic vibrational amplitudes as follows
:cite:p:`tongTheoryLowenergyElectron1975,vanhoveSurfaceCrystallographyLEED1979`:

.. math::
    \langle u^2 \rangle _{T} \approx \frac{9 \hbar^2}{4 m k_B \Theta_D} [1+ 4(\frac{T}{\Theta_D})^2 \int_{0}^{\frac{\Theta_D}{T}} \frac{x}{e^x - 1} dx].

Here :math:`\hbar` and :math:`k_B` are the reduced Planck constant and the
Boltzmann constant respectively.

The integral can not be evaluated analytically, but a good approximation is
given by a combination of low and high temperature limits

.. math::
    \langle u^2 \rangle _{T} \approx \sqrt{ (\langle u^2 \rangle _{T=0})^2 + (\langle u^2 \rangle _{T \rightarrow \infty})^2 }.

Evaluating these limits,

.. math ::
      \langle u^2 \rangle _{T=0} = \frac{9 \hbar^2}{4 m k_B \Theta_D},

      \langle u^2 \rangle _{T \rightarrow \infty} = \frac{9 \hbar^2 T}{m k_B \Theta_D^2},

gives 

.. math ::
      \langle u^2 \rangle _{T} \approx \frac{9 \hbar^2}{4 m k_B \Theta_D} \sqrt{1+16(\frac{T}{\Theta_D})^2}.
