The EXPBEAMS file
=================

The EXPBEAMS file contains the experimental data (beam intensities vs. 
energy, without normalization) to be compared against. The TensErLEED 
Manager will look for an EXPBEAMS.csv file (with or without the .csv 
extension) at initialization, but can also run without it up to the 
search. Executing search or R-factor calculations is only possible with 
an EXPBEAMS file as it requires experimental data to compare to.

For backwards compatibility, old experimental beam files formatted as 
:ref:`AUXEXPBEAMS<AUXEXPBEAMS>` can easily be transformed to the 
EXPBEAMS file format with the AUXEXPBEAMS_to_EXPBEAMS utility.

.. note::
    The EXPBEAMS.csv file generated by the ViPErLEED ImageJ 
    plug-ins contains some extra information in the header line that is 
    not used while comparing to calculated beams. The information is kept 
    for the possible interest of users.
    For each beam, the EXPBEAMS.csv file generated by the ViPErLEED ImageJ 
    plug-ins reports a (positive or negative) integer index between square 
    brackets. 
    This is a progressive index that identifies symmetry-equivalent beams, 
    and comes straight from the Pattern File that can be exported from the 
    Graphical User Interface 
    (|here| the extract of an example - see column 'groups'): 
    beams with the same absolute value of 'group' are symmetry-equivalent, 
    beams with negative 'group' are extinct.

.. warning::
    None of the EXPBEAMS.csv beams should have negative 
    intensities.
    Negative intensities usually signal an inappropriate background 
    subtraction. Beams with negative intensities will be offset to have 
    minimum intensity equal to zero (issuing warnings of having done so).
    This behavior prevents errors while writing input files for the FORTRAN 
    routines from TensErLEED. However, as this articial offset affects 
    the minima of the intensities, the R-factor may be impacted 
    significantly.
    We strongly advise that the problematic beams are fixed or discarded 
    by removing them from :ref:`IVBEAMS<IVBEAMS>`. 
    Consider improving background subtraction, or restricting the 
    affected beams to the energy range where intensities are positive.


.. warning::
    Gaps in the experimental beam set (i.e. a beam reappearing at higher 
    energies) are not currently neither supported in the spot tracker nor 
    in tleedm. We recommend using only the longest continuous part of any 
    beam.

**TODO** figure out how to (if at all) to include this pdf in Latex.
