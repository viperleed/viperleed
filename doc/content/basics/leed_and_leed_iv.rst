LEED-I(V)
=========

LEED-I(V) (also sometimes referred to as LEED-I(E)) is the quantitative analysis
of low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) patterns.
For a detailed introduction on the theory and applications of LEED, and
LEED-I(V) in particular, we suggest e.g. Chapter 4 in
:cite:t:`fausterSurfacePhysicsFundamentals2020,fausterOberflachenphysikGrundlagenUnd2013`
or the overview by :cite:t:`heinzElectronBasedMethods2013`.

In essence, the goal of any :term:`LEED-I(V)` calculation is the calculation of
energy-dependent electron-scattering amplitudes and intensities of diffracted
electron beams.
These intensity curves, taken as a function of the primary beam energy,
[often referred to as :math:`I(V)` curves or spectra] are very sensitive to the
precise position and vibrational amplitudes of each atom in the surface unit
cell.

In ViPErLEED, these calculations are performed by the viperleed calc Python
package, which acts as a comprehensive wrapper and major feature extension to
the established :term:`TensErLEED` program package.
Based on the input structure and the desired calculation parameters,
ViPErLEED can calculate the LEED-I(V) spectra for a given surface structure
(see also :ref:`reference calculation<ref-calc>`), compare these to experimental
data (see also :ref:`R-factor calculation<r-factor_calculation>`), and perform a structure
optimization (see :ref:`search<sec_search>`) using the
:ref:`tensor LEED approach<tensor_leed>`.

For computational details please have a look at the ViPErLEED paper (**TODO**)
and the original work describing TensErLEED by Blum and Heinz
:cite:p:`blumFastLEEDIntensity2001a`.
