.. _example_Fe2O3:

Hematite (012)-(1×1)
====================

**Note FK:** In 3-digit notation I would use (012) to denote our surface. This is (01-12) in 4 digits, equivalent to (1-102), 
which we mostly use these days. (102), as was previously written here, would be (10-12), equivalent to (-1102), which is NOT 
the same as (1-102).

Hematite (:math:`\alpha \text{-Fe}_2\text{O}_3`) is a very common iron oxide and a popular model system for (single-atom) catalysis :cite:p:`kraushoferAtomicscaleStructureHematite2018,franceschiModelSystemPhotocatalysis2020`.
The (012) surface exhibits two stable terminations under :term:`UHV` conditions: a stoichiometric (1×1) bulk-truncated termination, and a reduced (2×1) reconstruction :cite:p:`kraushoferAtomicscaleStructureHematite2018`.
Here we use the bulk-truncated (1×1) surface as an example system of a "medium complexity" surface and will compare experimental LEED :math:`I(V)` data with a theory calculation.


We start from experimental [#]_

We also use an existing :ref:`PHASESHIFTS file<phaseshifts>` and place it in the directory.

Let's run the initialization to check if all input files are interpreted correctly:
