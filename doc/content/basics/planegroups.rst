Plane symmetry groups
=====================

The symmetry of crystal surfaces can be classified as one of 17 possible plane
symmetry groups (also sometimes referred to as "wallpaper groups"). See also,
e.g., the corresponding
`Wikipedia article <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_planar_symmetry_groups>`_
for more information.

These groups are defined by the unit cell and symmetry operations that leave
the surface invariant, i.e. rotation axes, mirror planes, and glide planes.
Below, in :numref:`fig-symmetry-figures`, we show an overview of the 17 plane
groups, allowed symmetry operations and possible subgroups.

    Overview of the 17 plane groups and possible symmetry operations.
    For each group, exemplary symmetry-equivalent atoms are shown as filled
    and empty circles in the left panel, while the right panel shows the
    positions of the mirror, glide, and rotational symmetry elements.
    Blue and black arrows indicate linked in-plane displacements for the
    respective atoms. Double arrows in groups pm and cm indicate that movement
    is restricted along the mirror plane. Full (four-character) plane group
    designations are also indicated in gray,though ViPErLEED uses the standard
    short forms in all input and output. Possible subgroups and additional
    notes are shown to the right for each group.
