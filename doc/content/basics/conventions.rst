Conventions
===========

Coordinate system
-----------------

The lattice vectors describing the unit cell are named :math:`\vec{a}`, :math:`\vec{b}`, and :math:`\vec{c}`.
:math:`\vec{a}` and :math:`\vec{b}` must be in the :math:`xy` plane, and :math:`\vec{c}` must have a positive :math:`z` component.
The :math:`+z` direction is considered to be pointing outwards from the surface.
For :math:`(1 \times 1)` cells, it is common (and highly recommended) to choose the :math:`\vec{a}` and :math:`\vec{b}` vectors such that :math:`\mid \vec{a} \mid \leq \mid \vec{b} \mid`

Units
-----

ViPErLEED uses units of Ångström (Å) for all distances and vibrational amplitudes in inputs and outputs.
Some plots may display picometers (1 pm = 0.01 Å), but this will **always** be clearly labeled.

Energies for in- and output are in units of electron volts (eV).
Parts of TensErLEED and certain phaseshift generation programs may use units of `Hartree <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree>`__ internally (and in raw outputs).
ViPErLEED takes care of the conversion automatically.


Case sensitivity
----------------

Names of :ref:`input files<list_input_files>` are **case sensitive**, but :ref:`parameter<parameters>` keywords and element names (see below) are not.

Beam Indices
------------

Diffraction beam orders are defined by the indices :math:`h` and :math:`k`, relating the incident (:math:`\vec{k}`) and outgoing wave vectors (:math:`\vec{k'}`) via

.. math::
    \vec{k'} = \vec{k} + \begin{pmatrix}h \\ k \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}\vec{a^*} \\ \vec{b^*}\end{pmatrix}

where :math:`\vec{a^*}` and :math:`\vec{b^*}` are the reciprocal lattice vectors.
Beams are commonly labeled as :math:`(h|k)`, :math:`(h,k)` or :math:`(hk)`.
ViPErLEED generally uses the syntax ``(h | k)`` for machine readability and to avoid ambiguity.

Comments
--------

ViPErLEED input files allow comments starting with``#`` and ``!``.
Anything on a line after either of these symbols will be ignored.
Indentation is allowed, but will be ignored.
