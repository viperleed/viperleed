Example system: Cu(111)-Te ad-chains
====================================

The following example covers a ViPErLEED analysis and structure optimization
for a copper-telluride layer on Cu(111) based on the paper by
:cite:t:`kisslingerSubmonolayerCopperTelluride2021`. The experimental data and
the outline for the analysis steps described below were provided by the authors
of the publication. This system deals with a |5rt3| superstructure and has 10
atoms per bulk layer. It serves as an example for how a rather challenging
system can be treated with ViPErLEED. The analysis presented in the original
publication was performed using an early development version of ViPErLEED
:cite:p:`kisslingerSubmonolayerCopperTelluride2021`.

Introduction
============

The system we are analyzing is a |5rt3| superstructure of copper telluride on
the hexagonal Cu(111) substrate. The tellurium coverage is 0.40 monolayers,
which corresponds to four tellurium atoms per surface unit cell.

From experiments, we have a set of 79 beams in our energy range (20 to
500 eV), stored in the :ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv<expbeams>` file. These beams
correspond to a total energy range of around 17500 eV, of which only
around 1800 eV  are from integer-order beams.
:numref:`Cu(111)-Te_LEED_pattern` shows a snapshot
of the experimental LEED pattern.

For our example analysis, we start from a qualitatively correct structure
model (\ :ref:`POSCAR` file) with correct layer stacking
:cite:p:`kisslingerSubmonolayerCopperTelluride2021`.
However, the initial atom positions in the POSCAR are taken from bulk Cu,
so we should expect significant relaxation during structure optimization.
:numref:`Cu-Te_structure_fig` shows a rendering of the initial structure
(produced using
:term:`VESTA` :cite:p:`mommaVESTAThreedimensionalVisualization2011`).

   We will need to run multiple delta-amplitude calculations and structure
   optimizations. The individual :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS` files are not
   all shown in full below, but you can download all input files

PARAMETERS
==========

Similar to the previous examples, we start by setting up a
:ref:`PARAMETERS` file as in :numref:`list_cu-te_parameters`.

.. _list_cu-te_parameters:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Cu(111)-Te/PARAMETERS
   :language: console
   :caption: PARAMETERS file for |CuTe|.

Most of the parameters in this file have been explained in
:ref:`previous examples<example_ag_100>`, so we will skip some details
here. Worth mentioning in this particular case is that we use
:ref:`sitedef` to define the two topmost copper and tellurium atoms
as explicit sites. We also give the in-plane relationship between the surface
and bulk via the :ref:`SUPERLATTICE` parameter, to match the
convention used in :ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv<expbeams>`. We use the explicit
matrix notation as this particular reconstruction cannot be expressed
in Wood's notation.

.. tip::
    For non-obvious relationships between surface and bulk unit cells it is
    usually better to explicitly specify the :ref:`SUPERLATTICE` parameter.
    This ensures consistency with the experimental data. This is especially
    the case when multiple symmetry-induced domains coexist on the surface
    because of a difference in the plane groups (or unit-cell sizes)
    of the bulk and the superstructure. Since all domains are symmetry
    equivalent, ViPErLEED has no way to choose among them.

As usual, the :ref:`IVBEAMS` and :ref:`PHASESHIFTS` files are generated
automatically during initialization (:ref:`RUN = 0<run>`).
The :ref:`VIBROCC` file will also be generated by ViPErLEED based on the
:ref:`T_DEBYE`, :ref:`T_EXPERIMENT`, and :ref:`VIBR_AMP_SCALE` parameters
provided.

Rough DISPLACEMENTS
===================

For the delta-amplitudes calculation and the structure optimization
(:ref:`RUN = 1-3<run>`), we will start out with a very rough grid of
geometric optimizations (:ref:`DISPLACEMENTS` file). Refer
to :numref:`list_cu-te_diplacements_rough`. As is generally recommended,
we start with optimizations normal to the surface (:math:`z`). Immediately
following that comes an in-plane optimization. Due to the complex structure,
one in-plane direction is not sufficient: we need to run an optimization
along both :math:`x` *and* :math:`y` directions. For details on the syntax
used, see the entry on the :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS` file.

.. _list_cu-te_diplacements_rough:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Cu(111)-Te/DISPLACEMENTS_rough_1
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS (30 pm range) for |CuTe|.

.. note::
    Note that we allow displacements of up to 0.3 Å for tellurium to speed
    up the convergence in this example. Normally, this is not recommended,
    because the :ref:`tensor-LEED approximation<tensor_leed>` will lead to
    substantial :ref:`errors<tensor_leed_errors>` for such large displacements.

As usual, we can see a visualization of the optimization convergence in the
:ref:`Search-report.pdf<searchreportpdf>` file of the ``OUT`` directory.
:numref:`Cu(111)-Te_search_report` shows the first page of the
:ref:`Search-report.pdf<searchreportpdf>` file. The upper panel shows the
|R factor| as a function of the search progress (search generations). The
lower panel reports the deviation of the structural parameters over time.
Together, the two plots give an idea of the quality of the convergence of
the optimization.

.. _Cu(111)-Te_search_report:
.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Cu(111)-Te/figures/Search-report_rough.svg
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

   First page of the :ref:`Search-report.pdf<searchreportpdf>` file produced
   by |calc| for the first, rough structure optimization for |CuTe|.

The initial reference calculation :ref:`yields <r-factor_calculation>` an
|R factor| :math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.82` since our starting configuration
is very far from the ideal positions. Over the rough optimization, parameter
values are shifted by up to 0.24 Å compared to the initial model (this is
a lot!). The |R factor| drops to :math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.47`. This is
still quite poor, but the progress is encouraging.

Remember to keep the best fit-structure by calling the
:ref:`bookkeeper utility<bookkeeper>` with the ``--cont``
flag before proceeding:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ python3 bookkeeper.py --cont #[or ./bookkeeper --cont]

The |R factor| resulting from an additional reference calculation, is
decreased to :math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.33` compared to the
:math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.47` value at the end of the optimization run
— **a big difference**. This comes from the mentioned
:ref:`tensor-LEED error<tensor_leed_errors>`.

Fine DISPLACEMENTS and search parameters
========================================

Since in the former fit no parameter value reached the edge of the respective
variation range, we should follow up by running a second, less coarse,
optimization. For this stage, a choice of 10 pm range with 1 pm steps
(0.1 Å range with 0.01 Å steps) should be reasonable (see
:numref:`list_cu-te_diplacements_fine`).

.. _list_cu-te_diplacements_fine:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Cu(111)-Te/DISPLACEMENTS_rough_2
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS (10 pm range) for |CuTe|.

.. hint::
    In preparing this example we found that the default search parameters
    lead to rather slow convergence in this and the following steps. To speed 
    up the process, we recommend using these settings for :ref:`searchstart` 
    and :ref:`SEARCH_CONVERGENCE` (simply append the lines to PARAMETERS):

        .. code-block:: console

            SEARCH_START = centered
            SEARCH_CONVERGENCE gaussian = 0.05 0.5
            SEARCH_CONVERGENCE dgen dec = 50 1.5

    After the previous search steps, the parameters are close to the optimum.
    Therefore, the danger of getting trapped in a local |R-factor| minimum
    close to the starting position is low, and we can initialize the search
    at the previously determined values.
    The :ref:`SEARCH_CONVERGENCE` ``dgen`` parameter
    ensures that the search range shrinks more rapidly than with standard
    parameters.


The optimization on the 1 pm (0.01 Å) grid allows us to further reduce
the |R factor| to about :math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.23`, which is again a
good improvement on the previous value of :math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.33`.

Full-dynamic optimization
=========================

If we now visually compare experimental with calculated |IV| curves, we already
notice a good qualitative agreement. However, we find that the peak widths in
the experimental dataset seem to be consistently narrower than in our
calculation. This is generally a sign that the imaginary part of the
inner potential (|V0i|) of our calculation is off. To be more precise,
|V0i| is likely too large, as larger |V0i| increases peak widths and
smooths out the curves.

|V0i| strongly affects the |R factor|, but is hard to estimate for an unknown
system. Since we did not specify a value for |V0i| in PARAMETERS, ViPErLEED
took the default value of 4.5 eV (see :ref:`V0_IMAG<v0_imag>`). The
parameter |V0i| is not accessible in the tensor-LEED approximation, but
we can use a :ref:`full-dynamic optimization<fdoptimization>` to find an
optimal value. To do this, we set :ref:`RUN = 6<run>` and add this line to
:ref:`PARAMETERS`:

.. code-block:: console

    OPTIMIZE V0i = step 0.5

.. warning::
    Always make sure that the optimized value used for |V0i| is (i) reasonable
    (\ :math:`V_{0\mathrm{i}} \lesssim 7` eV), (ii) forms an actual minimum,
    and (iii) gives qualitatively correct |IV| curves.

    Since larger |V0i| values smooth out the |IV| curves, it is possible to
    deceptively decrease the |R factor| by arbitrarily increasing |V0i|. This
    usually happens in cases of very high |R-factor| values, where |V0i|
    optimization is not the main concern anyhow.

   :width: 60%
   :align: center

   File ``FD_Optimization.pdf`` showing parabolic fit and minimum value for
   |V0i|.

The optimized value for |V0i| will be output in the log file and automatically
added to the :ref:`PARAMETERS` file for subsequent runs.
Furthermore, ViPErLEED produces the files
:ref:`FD_Optimization.pdf<fdoptimizationdata>`
(\ :numref:`fig_cu-te_fdopt_v0i`) and
:ref:`FD_Optimization_beams.pdf<fdoptimizationbeams>`
(\ :numref:`fig_cu-te_fdopt_v0i_beams`) in the ``OUT`` directory.
``FD_Optimization_beams.pdf`` shows the calculated diffraction intensities
for different values of the optimized parameter, while ``FD_Optimization.pdf``
shows the |R factor|\ s corresponding to each trial value.

   |V0i| on the (1|0) beam. Note that the |V0i| variation
   only leads to minor changes of the spectral appearance.

Refined structure fit
=====================

As usual, we can now perform some final structure fits over a fine-grained
grid with subpicometre step. In particular, we should also optimize the
**vibrational amplitudes**, which we have skipped so far. We recommend
starting with the vibrational amplitudes here, since we have not touched
them at all in the previous optimization step.
:numref:`list_cu-te_diplacements_very_fine` shows the DISPLACEMENTS file
for the refined structure optimization.

.. _list_cu-te_diplacements_very_fine:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Cu(111)-Te/DISPLACEMENTS_fine_1
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS (0.5 pm step) for |CuTe|.

You may want to finish up with a last "fine tuning" of the vibrational
amplitudes and (\ :math:`z`) positions. See, for instance,
``DISPLACEMENTS_fine_2`` in the input files, but feel free to play around
with the setting yourself, to get a feeling for the available options.
Altogether, this should bring us to a Pendry |R factor|
:math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.19`, which is already a good agreement for
such a heavily corrugated surface. For more details concerning corrugated
surfaces see the discussion in
Ref. :cite:alp:`kisslingerSubmonolayerCopperTelluride2021`.

Error calculation
=================

We can also perform an error calculation for this system to gauge how
sensitive our result is to minor changes of structural parameters. This
can also give us an estimate of the uncertainty of the fit parameters.
To run an error calculation, we need a :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS` file specifying 
the requested steps.

The results are plotted in the :ref:`errorspdf` file, shown in

layers have a drastic impact on the |R factor|. Thus, we can be fairly
confident that all varied atoms are indeed present within the true surface
structure.
