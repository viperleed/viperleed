==================================
Example system: Fe₂O₃(1−102)-(1×1)
==================================

Hematite (`ɑ`-Fe₂O₃) is one of the most common, naturally occurring iron
oxides. Its surfaces are popular model systems for (single-atom) catalysis
:cite:p:`kraushoferAtomicscaleStructureHematite2018,franceschiModelSystemPhotocatalysis2020`,
photocatalysis and the study of mineral–water interfaces.

The :math:`(1\bar{1}02)` surface — also referred to as :math:`(012)`, or r-cut
— exhibits two stable terminations under :term:`UHV` conditions: a
stoichiometric, bulk-truncated, (1×1) termination, and a reduced (2×1)
reconstruction :cite:p:`kraushoferAtomicscaleStructureHematite2018`.
Here we use the bulk-truncated (1×1) surface as an example system of an
oxide surface with medium complexity and will compare experimental |LEED-IV|
data with a theory calculation in ViPErLEED.

This example is a simplified version of the example calculation shown in the
main ViPErLEED paper :cite:p:`kraushoferViPErLEEDPackageCalculation2025`. For more details on the full
calculation, see the paper and the supplementary information.

Introduction
============

To set up the calculation, we need to start from a structure model of the (1×1)
surface in the POSCAR format. We can easily build this ourselves from a
(`ɑ`-Fe₂O₃) bulk structure. For this example, we use the structure by
:cite:t:`maslenSynchrotronXrayStudy1994`, which can be found on the
`Crystallography Open Database (entry 2101167) <http://www.crystallography.net/cod/2101167.html>`_.

.. warning::
    Bulk structures can be found in various online databases, but you should be
    careful to choose a model with the correct **experimental** lattice
    parameters (as determined by :term:`XRD`).
    Lattice parameters from, e.g., :term:`DFT` calculations may be off by ~1%,
    which will strongly affect the |R factor|. Lattice parameters are not
    accessible in the :ref:`tensor-LEED approximation<tensor_leed>`, but they
    can be optimized in a :ref:`full-dynamic optimization<fdoptimization>`.

To go from the hexagonal bulk unit cell to the unit cell for the
:math:`(1\bar{1}02)` surface, we need to apply a suitable change of
basis

.. math::
    (\mathbf{a}', \mathbf{b}', \mathbf{c}') = (\mathbf{a},\mathbf{b},\mathbf{c}) P,

with

.. math::
    P  = \frac{1}{3} \begin{pmatrix}
                        3 & 1  & 2 \\
                        0 & 2  & 4 \\
                        0 & -1 & 1
                     \end{pmatrix} .

In :term:`VESTA`, you can do this by selecting
:menuselection:`Edit --> Edit Data --> Unit cell --> Transform`. To
avoid problems later on, it is useful to also delete the unit cell
symmetry before applying a transformation. You can do that by pressing
the :guilabel:`Remove symmetry` button in
:menuselection:`Edit --> Edit Data --> Unit cell`.
When applying the transformation, VESTA may prompt you and ask what
to do with the atoms in the new unit cell. Make sure to choose
:guilabel:`Search atoms in the new unit-cell and add them as new sites`.
The unit-cell transformation will introduce duplicate atoms, which can be
deleted using the :guilabel:`Remove duplicate atoms` button in
:menuselection:`Edit --> Structure parameters`.

To create a suitable surface slab (as expected by ViPErLEED), we can then
replicate the unit cell along |c| and (optionally) remove the topmost layer
to create a vacuum interface. In VESTA you can do this by applying a
transformation that "stretches" the cell in the |c| direction. You may
have to use the "Initialize current matrix" button first to apply the
transformation to the previously transformed unit cell. Use

.. math::
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 2
    \end{pmatrix}

to make the slab twice as thick along |c|. Choose again
:guilabel:`Search atoms in the new unit-cell and add them as new sites`.
You can then add a vacuum gap by applying the same transformation again,
this time not adding any new atoms (choose :guilabel:`Do nothing` in the
prompt). This is not strictly required by ViPErLEED, but makes it easier
to recognize which layer is our surface.

Our starting POSCAR file contains 40 atoms in total, which corresponds
to four repeat units (layers) of 4 Fe and 6 O atoms each.
See :numref:`fig_Fe2O3_layers` for a side view of the structure.


PARAMETERS and VIBROCC
======================

As in the previous examples, we begin with a simple :ref:`PARAMETERS` file
(\ :numref:`list_fe2o3_parameters`).

.. _list_fe2o3_parameters:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/PARAMETERS
   :language: console
   :caption: PARAMETERS for `ɑ`-Fe₂O₃\ :math:`(1\overline{1}02)`-(1×1).

The settings concerning global parameters and the :ref:`VIBROCC` file have been
discussed in detail elsewhere
[see, e.g., the :ref:`Ag(100) example<example_ag_100>`].
In particular, we specify the parameter :ref:`BULK_LIKE_BELOW` with a suitable
value (0.35 for the POSCAR file constructed in the :ref:`sec_fe2o3_intro`).
ViPErLEED will use it to derive the values of the :ref:`BULK_REPEAT`,
:ref:`LAYER_CUTS`, and :ref:`N_BULK_LAYERS` parameters, as shown in
section :ref:`sec_fe2o3_init` below.

We also use the :ref:`sitedef` parameter to define which sites should be 
treated separately by ViPErLEED. In this case, we declare two ``surf``\ ace
sites for iron and oxygen, selecting the two topmost atoms of each species.
These atoms will be assigned dedicated vibrational amplitudes and electron–atom
scattering phase shifts (see file :ref:`PHASESHIFTS`). All remaining atoms
are automatically given a ``def``\ :spelling:ignore:`ault` label instead.

Note also that we set the :ref:`beamincidence` parameter to :math:`\phi=90°` to 
match the input structure with the crystal orientation used in the experiment. 
This setting won't have any effect initially, since the polar angle is set to 
:math:`\theta = 0°`. However, we will optimize :math:`\theta` later on, at 
which point the value of :math:`\phi` will be important.

To set initial vibrational amplitudes for the surface atoms, we can either
supply a :ref:`VIBROCC` file, or let ViPErLEED calculate them based on the
Debye temperature of the sample.
In this case, we set the Debye temperature and experiment temperature via the 
:ref:`T_DEBYE`, :ref:`T_EXPERIMENT` parameters.
Note that this Debye temperature was chosen based on literature values and an
previous optimization run. For more details, see the main ViPErLEED publication.


.. _sec_fe2o3_init:

Initialization
==============

We can now run the initialization to check if all input files are interpreted
correctly. If so, the :ref:`log<log_files_calc>` should look similar to
:numref:`list_fe2o3_init_log`.

.. _list_fe2o3_init_log:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/log_init.txt
   :language: console
   :caption:
        Log file after initialization for
        `ɑ`-Fe₂O₃\ :math:`(1\overline{1}02)`-(1×1).

The initialization log shows that the input files are interpreted correctly and
that the right plane group (``pg[0 1]``) is detected.
It also shows that the bulk structure and repeat vector have been identified.
This is reflected in the PARAMETERS file, which should now contain additional
lines as in :numref:`list_fe2o3_auto_parameters`.

.. _list_fe2o3_auto_parameters:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/PARAMETERS_bulk_detected
   :language: console
   :caption: PARAMETERS after initialization.

The detected layers and bulk repeat vector are also shown in
:numref:`fig_Fe2O3_layers` for clarity.

.. _fig_Fe2O3_layers:
.. figure:: /_static/paper_figures/Hematite-Layers_embedded.svg
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

   Visualization of the crystal structure with highlighted layers, and the bulk
   repeat vector. Fe atoms are depicted as large yellow spheres, O atoms as
   small red ones. This figure is taken from the first ViPErLEED paper
   :cite:p:`kraushoferViPErLEEDPackageCalculation2025`.


At this stage, before proceeding, you should always check the detected bulk
structure and spacing, as it is crucial for the calculation.
To help with this, ViPErLEED provides the files
:ref:`POSCAR_bulk and POSCAR_bulk_appended<poscar_bulk>`.
The former contains the crystal structure of the bulk as detected by ViPErLEED;
the latter contains the surface slab with additional bulk layers appended to
it. You can visualize these files in VESTA to check if the bulk structure is
as you expect. In particular, one should make sure that the bulk stoichiometry
for ``POSCAR_bulk``, and the bulk layer spacing for ``POSCAR_bulk_appended``,
are correct.

Reference calculation and structure optimization
================================================

If the initialization ran without errors, we can proceed to the reference
calculation and structure optimization. You can find more details about
what happens in each section of a ViPErLEED |LEED-IV| calculation
:ref:`here<work-segments>`.

In short, the :ref:`reference calculation<ref-calc>` performs a full-dynamic
LEED calculation to generate |IV| curves for the input structure. |IV| curves
are very sensitive to the exact atomic positions and vibrational amplitudes.
Because of this, it is necessary to optimize the structure to get the best fit
to the experimental |IV| data. The reference calculation is the starting point
for this optimization, but full-dynamic calculations are computationally too
expensive for the optimization, which requires a large number of iterations.
We can perform the optimization in a computationally more efficient way by
using a perturbative approach, where we calculate the effect of small changes
to the input structure.
This is done in the :ref:`delta-amplitudes calculation<sec_deltas>` and
:ref:`structure optimization<sec_search>`.

To run these sections, we also need to specify which parameters we want to vary
(i.e., the parameter space). We do this by providing a :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS` 
file, as in :numref:`list_fe2o3_displacements_1`.

.. _list_fe2o3_displacements_1:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/DISPLACEMENTS_L1-2_looped
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS

Here, we specify that we want to optimize the atomic out-of-plane positions
of all atoms in the first and second layer from −0.05 Å to
+0.05 Å in steps of 0.01 Å. At the same time, we also optimize the
vibrational amplitudes of the surface atoms. We subsequently turn to the
in-plane position of the atoms in the first two layers. Note also the
``<loop>`` and ``</loop>`` tags at the beginning and end of the file,
which indicate that these steps should be repeated until convergence.
For more details on the syntax, see the page on the :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS` file.

We can now start the calculation by setting the :ref:`RUN` parameter to
``1-3 1`` and starting |calc| again. This will execute the reference
calculation, the delta-amplitude calculation and the looped structure
optimization in order. By appending the ``1`` to the ``1-3``, we also
tell ViPErLEED to finish with a second reference calculation of the
optimized structure.

Once finished, you can check the log files to see if the calculation ran
without errors.
You can also find the final |R factor| at the end of the log file (see
the extract in :numref:`list_fe2o3_log_search_1`).

.. _list_fe2o3_log_search_1:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/log_search_1.txt
   :language: console
   :caption: Final log

:numref:`fig_Fe2O3_search_progress_1` shows the evolution of the |R factor|
during the optimization process.
The initial |R factor| (:math:`R_\mathrm{P}\approx0.78`) is very high.
This is not unusual when starting from a totally unrelaxed, bulk-truncated
structure, as multiple iterations of reference calculation and structure
optimizations are usually necessary for convergence.

.. _fig_Fe2O3_search_progress_1:
.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/figures/Search-report-first_optimization.svg
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

   Upper half of page 1 for the ``Search-progress.pdf`` file for the
   first optimization run of `ɑ`-Fe₂O₃\ :math:`(1\overline{1}02)`-(1×1).


.. note::

   You may also notice that the |R factor| for the second reference calculation
   is quite different from the |R factor| obtained at the end of the structure
   optimization. This is to be expected, as the perturbative tensor-LEED
   approximation used in the structure optimization is only valid for small
   changes to the structure.
   The final reference calculation removes this error and gives a more accurate
   |R factor|.


Optimizing the incidence angle
==============================

In our case, the |R factor| has improved significantly after the
first structure optimization, but is still far from a good fit at
:math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.40`. This is because our measurement
was performed on a UHV manipulator that does not have enough degrees
of freedom in rotation to perfectly align the sample with the LEED optics.
We thus know that we need to optimize the incidence angle of the electron beam
to get a closer correspondence between the experimental and calculated |IV|
curves.

The incidence angle is not a parameter that is accessible in the
tensor-LEED approximation. In ViPErLEED, we can instead optimize the
incidence angle using a full-dynamic optimization, which optimizes a
parameter by performing a full-dynamic reference calculation at each
iteration.

To do this, we need to edit the PARAMETERS file (see
:numref:`list_fe2o3_opt_theta_params`) to set :ref:`RUN=6<run>` and provide
the ``OPTIMIZE`` parameter to specify which parameter we want to optimize.

.. _list_fe2o3_opt_theta_params:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/PARAMETERS_optimize_theta
   :language: console
   :caption:
       PARAMETERS, with OPTIMIZE specified for the polar incidence
       angle :math:`\theta` of the primary electron beam.

Here, we set the initial step size to 1° and convergence criterion to 0.1°.
After running the calculation, we find a minimum at about
:math:`\theta \approx 0.87°` which already reduces the |R factor| to about
:math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.22`. We can also see that the |IV| curves, and
consequently the |R factor|, are very sensitive to the incidence angle in the
:ref:`FD_Optimization.pdf<fdoptimizationbeams>` and
:ref:`FD_Optimization_beams.pdf<fdoptimizationbeams>` files (see
:numref:`fig_Fe2O3_fd_opt_theta_values` and
:numref:`fig_Fe2O3_fd_opt_theta_beams`).

.. _fig_Fe2O3_fd_opt_theta_values:

   :ref:`FD_Optimization.pdf<fdoptimizationbeams>`.

   :width: 70%
   :align: center

   |IV| curves for beam (1|1) as shown in
   :ref:`FD_Optimization_beams.pdf<fdoptimizationbeams>`.

.. note::

   If the incidence angle is off-normal, it is advisable to optimize it
   relatively early on, before performing structural optimization deeper
   into the surface. Otherwise, the error in the |IV| curves may incorrectly
   be compensated by moving the atoms relative to the incident beam, which
   will result in incorrect positions relative to the bulk. This becomes more
   likely if bulklike layers contribute only weakly to the |IV| curves, i.e.,
   when optimizing layers far below the surface.


Refining the structure
======================

After optimizing the incidence angle, we can perform another structure
optimization to refine the structure. To do this, we again provide a
:ref:`DISPLACEMENTS` file to specify the range of parameters we want 
to optimize. We can then run the calculation by setting the :ref:`RUN` 
parameter back to ``1-3 1``. Note also that we should now remove or 
comment out the ``OPTIMIZE`` parameter, as the superfluous parameter 
will raise a warning otherwise.

At this point, the best strategy to achieve the optimal fit is generally not
known *a priori*, and the process may involve some trial and error.
In particular, you may need to play around with multiple iterations
of coarse- and fine-grained structure optimizations, and possibly
also adjust the :ref:`convergence parameters<search_convergence>`.

In this case, we found that by first performing another looped structure
optimization for the first two layers (atoms ``* L1-2``), and then adding the
third-layer atoms (atoms ``* L1-3``) to the optimization, we could reliably
reduce the |R factor| to about :math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.16`.\ [#]_

For reference, the final |R factor| obtained by in the more detailed calculation
discussed in the main ViPErLEED paper was :math:`R_\mathrm{P} = 0.1537`.


.. [#] Optimizing all three layers right away with the default convergence
       parameters caused the |R factor| to get trapped in a local minimum.
