===============================
Example system: Ir(100)-(2×1)-O
===============================

In this tutorial we go through a ViPErLEED structure analysis for an Ir(100)
surface with adsorbed oxygen, creating a (\ :math:`2\times1`) superstructure.
The structure and analysis is based on
Ref. :cite:alp:`ferstlStructureOrderingOxygen2016`. The experimental
data and input model were provided by Lutz Hammer.

We will begin by running a reference calculation and a rough structure
optimization. Following this, we move to a finer search grid and run a
:ref:`full-dynamic optimization <fdoptimization>` of the inner potential |V0i|.
After achieving a satisfactory |R factor|, we use the ViPErLEED
:ref:`error calculation<error_calculation>` to estimate how much
small changes of atomic positions affect the |R factor|. This will
give margins for the statistical uncertainties of the determined
parameters.

Introduction
============

We start from experimental |LEED-IV| curves which are saved in file
:ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv<expbeams>`. As reference structure, we use a :ref:`POSCAR`
file containing an Ir(100) surface that was hand made from a bulk structure.
An additional adsorbed oxygen atom is placed at a bridge site, such that each
surface iridium atom binds to one oxygen atom.
The height above the surface was chosen to achieve a reasonable Ir–O bond
length. See :numref:`fig_ir_start` for a visualization of the structure
(using :term:`VESTA` :cite:`mommaVESTAThreedimensionalVisualization2011`).
In this visualization, we also drew a plane orthogonal to the unit-cell
vector |c| at fractional position :math:`c=0.35`. We will use the
:ref:`BULK_LIKE_BELOW` parameter to declare that everything below
this cutoff is bulklike.

   |POSCAR| rendered in :term:`VESTA`, viewed along |a| (left), |b| (center)
   and |c| (right). Ir atoms are shown in blue, oxygen in red.

.. hint::
   Of course there are other possible structural models, including adsorption
   at hollow, top, or Ir-sharing bridge sites. Even surface reconstructions
   (e.g., missing row) are conceivable. Here, we concentrate exclusively on
   the correct structural model, which is known from the literature
   :cite:p:`johnsonUnusualBridgedSite2000,ferstlStructureOrderingOxygen2016`.

   Often the adsorption site (or generally, the structural model) may not be
   known a priori. In that case, at least a rough analysis has to be performed
   for each reasonable model in order to find the most promising one(s), before
   further optimization is performed.


PARAMETERS and rough DISPLACEMENTS
==================================

We start by setting up a rudimentary :ref:`PARAMETERS` file,
very similar to the one described in the tutorial for the
:ref:`Ag(100)-(1×1) surface<example_ag_100>`, as per
:numref:`list_ir_parameters`.

.. _list_ir_parameters:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Ir(100)-O/PARAMETERS
   :language: console
   :caption: |PARAMETERS| file for Ir(100)-(2×1)-O.

GLOBAL PARAMETERS
    At the top of the file, we specify some general settings, such as the
    energy range to be used and our initial guess for the imaginary part
    of the inner potential |V0i|.
    We will run a :ref:`reference calculation<ref-calc>`,
    :ref:`delta-amplitude<sec_deltas>`, and a
    :ref:`structure search<sec_search>` back to back,
    so we specify :ref:`RUN = 1-3<run>`.

    To reduce computation time for this example, we also limit the maximum
    angular momentum quantum number to be used in the calculations by
    TensErLEED with the :ref:`LMAX` parameter.

PARAMETERS FOR INTERPRETING THE POSCAR
    As mentioned in the :ref:`sec_ir_intro`, we let ViPErLEED find the
    bulk-repeat unit by itself. For this, we set the :ref:`BULK_LIKE_BELOW`
    parameter at the height where we drew the plane in :numref:`fig_ir_start`.

    Using the :ref:`sitedef` parameter, we specify that the topmost iridium
    atoms should be treated separately. These Ir atoms are differently
    coordinated than bulk Ir atoms and thus will presumably have a different
    vibration amplitude. For completeness, we also specify the site type
    ``O_ads`` for the adsorbed oxygen atom. However, since there is only one
    oxygen atom in the structure, this will not change the behavior and we
    could also skip that line.

PARAMETERS FOR VIBROCC
    Since we don't have a :ref:`VIBROCC` file yet, we need to specify the
    parameters :ref:`T_DEBYE`, :ref:`T_EXPERIMENT`, and :ref:`VIBR_AMP_SCALE`.
    Note that we can only give one value for the Debye temperature for both
    oxygen and iridium. The initial vibration amplitudes will be calculated
    as explained in the section on :ref:`T_DEBYE`.

.. tip::
    Grouping the settings in the |PARAMETERS| file as described above is not
    required, but it helps with readability.


For the delta-amplitudes calculation and structure optimization, we also need
to set up a :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS` file. Since this is the first run starting
from a totally unrelaxed model, we begin with a rather large range and a
relatively rough grid, as in :numref:`list_ir_displacements_rough`.

.. _list_ir_displacements_rough:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Ir(100)-O/DISPLACEMENTS_rough
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS file for the first optimization of Ir(100)-(2×1)-O.

By setting multiple search blocks in DISPLACEMENTS, we can tell ViPErLEED to
execute them one after the other. When starting to optimize a new system such
as here, it is generally a good idea to begin with a geometric optimization
perpendicular to the surface (i.e., along |z|). This is because the |LEED-IV|
curves are most sensitive to out-of-plane displacements.

We then follow up with rough optimizations of in-plane positions and
vibration amplitudes of surface atoms.\ [1]_
For the in-plane optimization, we use a simplified assignment for all four
layers, although any movement along the |x| direction (here parallel to the
|a| unit vector) is forbidden by symmetry for Ir atoms in the second and
fourth layers.\ [2]_ ViPErLEED automatically sorts out any symmetry-forbidden
displacements, cf. :numref:`fig_Ir_O_search_progress_2`.

.. note::
   TensErLEED cannot simultaneously optimize displacements in different
   directions for a given atom. Vibration amplitudes can be optimized
   together with one geometric displacement; here we do it separately to
   speed up the calculation. However, it is generally advisable to combine
   vibration-amplitude displacements and displacements along the |z|
   direction, as the parameters may be coupled.

With the files set up, we can start the ViPErLEED calculation.
During the first initialization ViPErLEED will generate :ref:`IVBEAMS`
and :ref:`PHASESHIFTS` files.


.. note::
    You will notice that the first time we run a new system, ViPErLEED stops
    execution after the initialization. This is on purpose, and is supposed
    to give the user a chance to double check the recognized symmetry and
    annotated |POSCAR|.

    You will need to **restart the run manually** after making these checks.

When the run is finished, we will see in the log file that the |R factor|
has decreased quite a bit. The first reference calculation gave a value
of :math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.55`, but |RP| has dropped to around
:math:`\approx 0.21` over the search. We can get a better idea of how
the search has converged by taking a look at the file :ref:`searchprogresspdf`
in the |SUPP| directory.

.. _fig_Ir_O_search_progress_1:
.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Ir(100)-O/figures/progress_1_page_1.svg
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

   Upper half of page 1 for ``Search-progress.pdf`` for the rough initial
   structure optimization of Ir(100)-(2×1)-O.

:numref:`fig_Ir_O_search_progress_1` shows a plot of the decreasing |R factor|
during the various stages of the search. We clearly see that both geometric
optimizations made quick progress in terms of convergence. This is expected
when starting from an unrelaxed surface slab like the one used here. The other
pages of the file give us some insight into how each atomic parameter developed
during the structure optimization.

.. _fig_Ir_O_search_progress_2:
.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Ir(100)-O/figures/progress_1_page_2.svg
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

   Pages 2–4 of ``Search-progress.pdf`` for the rough initial
   structure optimization of Ir(100)-(2×1)-O (white space removed).

:numref:`fig_Ir_O_search_progress_2` shows that the (|z|) position of
the  oxygen adsorbate has changed a good amount. Further, we see that the
vibration amplitude of the oxygen atom has gone down, while the amplitude
for iridium has gone up.


Fine DISPLACEMENTS and tensor-LEED error
========================================

The rough optimization has already significantly brought down the |R factor|.
We should now continue with a finer search grid. For this, we use a similar
:ref:`DISPLACEMENTS` file, but with much smaller range and step size (see
:numref:`list_ir_displacements_fine`). We now rerun with :ref:`RUN = 1-3<run>`
to perform a fresh reference calculation for the new starting positions. This
is advisable because parameter deviations during the previous fit were not
negligible.

.. _list_ir_displacements_fine:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Ir(100)-O/DISPLACEMENTS_fine
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS file for the fine optimization of Ir(100)-(2×1)-O.

When looking at the log file after the reference calculation, we further
notice something important: The |R factor| of the reference calculation
(\ :math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.18`) *is different* from the one we
obtained from the :ref:`superposition<super_pos>` calculation at the end
of the previous run (\ :math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.21`). This comes from
the :ref:`error of the tensor-LEED approximation<tensor_leed_errors>` used
for the structure optimization. In this case, the real |R factor| — as
obtained from the reference calculation — is lower. However, this is not
always the case. You should **never** rely on the |R factor| produced by the
superposition calculation as a final result, but rather run a final reference
calculation at the end of your analysis.\ [3]_

Full-dynamic optimization
=========================

After the finer search run finishes, we see that the |R factor| has again
dropped quite significantly. The |R factor| is now below 0.1, which already
indicates very good agreement, but we can get better yet.

Now, remember that in the :ref:`PARAMETERS` file of
:numref:`list_ir_parameters` we had to put in an initial guess for the
imaginary part of the inner potential |V0i|. We would now like to also
optimize this non-structural parameter. However, it is not accessible
in :ref:`the tensor-LEED approach<tensor_leed>`, which can only treat
perturbations on an atom-by-atom basis. Instead, we can use the
:ref:`full-dynamic optimization<fdoptimization>` to find an optimal
value for |V0i|.

During the :ref:`full-dynamic optimization<fdoptimization>`, multiple reference
calculations are run while the chosen global parameter is varied. ViPErLEED
then tries to determine an optimal value using a parabola fit. We select |V0i|
for optimization by adding the following line to |PARAMETERS|:

.. code-block:: console

    OPTIMIZE V0i = step 0.5

We then chose to run the :ref:`full-dynamic optimization<fdoptimization>` by
setting the parameter :ref:`RUN = 6<run>` and restarting. Once finished, the
log file will let us know of the optimized value for the chosen parameter.
ViPErLEED also produces a file called ``FD_Optimization.pdf`` in the |OUT|
directory which contains a visualization of the |R factor|\ s calculated for
the various values of the parameter and a fit parabola.
It is shown in :numref:`fig_ir_fdopt`.


.. _fig_ir_fdopt:
.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Ir(100)-O/figures/FD_Optimization.svg
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

   ``FD_Optimization.pdf`` file resulting from the full-dynamic optimization
   of the imaginary part of the inner potential, |V0i|, for Ir(100)-(2×1)-O.

.. note::
    ViPErLEED will also automatically add the new, optimized value to the
    :ref:`PARAMETERS` file and comment out the line containing the previous
    value.

Following the |V0i| optimization we can also run a final structure
optimization, since the new value for |V0i| may have slightly affected
the optimal positions. Using a (very fine) :math:`0.002` Å grid
(``DISPLACEMENTS_very_fine`` in the provided example files) we
manage to get a final |R factor| of around :math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.088`.

Error calculation
=================

Now that we have found a good structure fit, we can run a ViPErLEED
:ref:`error calculation<error_calculation>` to estimate how sensitive the
|R factor| is to small changes of specific parameters. As input for the error
calculation, we need a :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS` file containing the desired range
and steps. The format of the file is the same as used for the delta-amplitudes
calculation and structure search.

.. _list_ir_error_calc:
.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Ir(100)-O/DISPLACEMENTS_errors
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS file for the error calculation.


Using the DISPLACEMENTS file in :numref:`list_ir_error_calc`, we run the error
calculation by selecting the segment :ref:`RUN = 5<run>`.
The :ref:`result <errorspdf_header>` will again be saved in the |OUT|
directory. ViPErLEED generates a plot of the error curves in :file:`Errors.pdf`
and stores the raw data in :file:`Errors.csv`. The :file:`Errors.pdf` file in
:numref:`fig_ir_errors_geo` shows that displacement of surface atoms even by a
few picometres drastically increases the |R factor|. Here, atom 1 is the
oxygen adsorbate and atoms 2 and 3 are the topmost iridium ones.

   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   Part of :file:`Errors.pdf` showing the effects of geometric displacements.

.. note::
   The point of intersection between the error curve for a parameter and the
   horizontal line labeled :math:`R_\mathrm{P} + \textrm{var}(R_\mathrm{P})`
   gives a measure for the statistical error of the parameter
   :cite:p:`heinzElectronBasedMethods2013` (see also the section on
   :ref:`Errors<error_calculation>`).

Changes in the vibration amplitude of the surface atoms
(\ :numref:`fig_ir_errors_vib`) also strongly affect the |R factor|.

.. _fig_ir_errors_vib:
.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Ir(100)-O/figures/errors_vib.svg
   :width: 50%
   :align: center

   Part of ``Errors.pdf`` showing the effects of changes in the
   vibration amplitude of the topmost atoms.

In general, error plots for geometric displacements tend to show a parabolic
profile close to the minimum. Error plots for vibration amplitudes tend to
be more asymmetric, as these amplitudes enter the calculation differently
(i.e., via the Debye–Waller factor).

.. warning::
   Error curves are also subject to **errors of the tensor-LEED approximation**.
   |R-factor| values obtained for large deviations should be taken with care.

.. [1] It is not recommended to fit any vibration amplitude of bulk atoms as
       long as reliable information about the substrate Debye temperature is
       available.
.. [2] Actually, no in-plane movement is allowed for these Ir atoms. They
       coincide with twofold rotation axes of the pmm group. See also the
       ``FreeDir`` column in the |POSCAR| file after initialization.
.. [3] There is one exception to this rule. The full-dynamic reference
       calculation cannot provide exact results when an atom has mixed
       chemical composition and the elements have different optimized
       positions. This is because only one position can be specified
       for each atom. In this case, the tensor-LEED approximation is
       the only viable alternative.
