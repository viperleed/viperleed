Units
-----

ViPErLEED uses units of ångström (Å) for all distances and vibrational
amplitudes in inputs and outputs. Some plots may display picometres
(1 pm = 0.01 Å), but this will **always** be clearly labeled.

Energies for input and output are in units of electronvolts (eV). Parts
of TensErLEED and certain phase-shift-generation programs use units of
`hartree <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartree>`__ internally and in
the raw outputs. ViPErLEED takes care of the conversion automatically.
