Rfactor_plots
=============

The Rfactor_plots files (``Rfactor_plots_refcalc.pdf``
and ``Rfactor_plots_superpos.pdf``) plot the results of the |R-factor|
calculations. Theoretical and experimental |IV| curves are drawn for
every beam, and the |R factor| per beam is given.

``Rfactor_plots_refcalc.pdf`` is generated after the |R-factor|
:ref:`calculation<r-factor_calculation>` following the
:ref:`refercence calculation<ref-calc>` (section :ref:`RUN = 11<run>`),
while ``Rfactor_plots_superpos.pdf`` is generated after the |R-factor|
:ref:`calculation<r-factor_calculation>` following the
:ref:`superposition<super_pos>` (section :ref:`RUN = 12<run>`).

Note that the curves are the ones output by the TensErLEED |R-factor|
program (theo.column and exp.column), not the ones found in
:ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv<EXPBEAMS>` / :ref:`THEOBEAMS.csv<THEOBEAMS>` /
:ref:`FITBEAMS.csv<FITBEAMS>`, and may differ from the original data
in that an inner potential shift (\ :ref:`IVSHIFTRANGE`),
polynomial interpolation of both theoretical and experimental curves, as
well as smoothing of experimental curves (:ref:`RFACTORSMOOTH`) and 
normalization may have been applied.

The appearance of the |R-factor| plots can be modified with the :ref:`PLOT_IV`
parameter.

   Example of a Rfactor_plots_(refcalc).pdf file created by ViPErLEED during
   the example on the Hematite :math:`(012)-(1 \times 1)` surface discussed
   :ref:`here<example_Fe2O3>`. This partical dense overview was created
   with the setting ``PLOT_IV perpage = 3 8``.
