FITBEAMS
========

The FITBEAMS.csv file contains the theoretical beams (beam intensities vs.
energy, without normalization) generated by the superpos calculation.
A second FITBEAMS_norm.csv file contains the same data, normalized to have
the same maximum for every beam.

**Format:** Like :ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv<EXPBEAMS>`

Note that the FITBEAMS contain errors due to the tensor-LEED approximation.
A new reference calculation should be performed to obtain reliable data.
The corresponding output file from the reference calculation is named
:ref:`THEOBEAMS.csv<THEOBEAMS>`
