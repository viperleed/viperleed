FD_Optimization.pdf and FD_Optimization.csv
===========================================

The FD_Optimization files contain |R factor|\ s as a function of the 
parameter under variation during a 
:ref:`full-dynamic optimization<Fdoptimization>`.
The FD_Optimization.csv file contains two columns with values of the 
parameter under variation, and the corresponding |R factor|, respectively.
FD_Optimization.pdf shows a scatter plot of these data points, together 
with a parabola fit to the data. The coordinates of the parabola minimum
(parameter value and corresponding predicted |R factor|) are also printed 
into the FD_Optimization.pdf plot.
