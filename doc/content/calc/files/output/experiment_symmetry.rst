=======================

The :file:`experiment_symmetry.ini` file is generated during
:ref:`initialization<initialization>`, and contains basic information on the
symmetry and energy range. It serves as an input file to the GUI, which can
display a simulated LEED pattern for the structure, and export a "pattern file"
for the Spot Tracker of the :ref:`imagej_plugins`.
