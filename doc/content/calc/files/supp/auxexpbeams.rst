AUXEXPBEAMS
===========

The AUXEXPBEAMS file contains the experimental data (beam intensities
vs. energy) to be compared against, formatted as input for TensErLEED. 
Generated from an :ref:`EXPBEAMS` file before the search is run.

For backwards compatibility, old experimental beam files formatted as 
AUXEXPBEAMS can easily be transformed to the :ref:`EXPBEAMS` 
file format with the :ref:`aux_to_exp` utility.
