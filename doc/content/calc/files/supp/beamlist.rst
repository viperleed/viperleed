BEAMLIST
========

The file contains a list of all beams used for the calculation, which is 
defined by the energy range (see :ref:`THEO_ENERGIES`).
Any beam not listed in BEAMLIST cannot be used in calculations, so the beams in 
the :ref:`IVBEAMS` file should always be a subset of the beams in BEAMLIST.
