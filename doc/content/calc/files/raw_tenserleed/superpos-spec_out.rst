superpos-spec.out
=================

The file ``superpos-spec.out`` contains the raw TensErLEED output of beam
intensities from the :ref:`superposition<super_pos>` for the best-fit structure
as found by the :ref:`structure search<sec_search>`. It is the equivalent for
the superposition of the :ref:`file refcalc-fd.out<fd_out>` as output by the
:ref:`reference calculation<ref-calc>` and uses the same syntax.
