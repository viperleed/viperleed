============
The R factor
============

The reliability factor (R factor) is a measure for the deviation between
two :math:`I(V)` curves or two sets of :math:`I(V)` curves. 
Structure optimization (:ref:`search section<sec_search>`) minimizes the R factor between the calculated and experimental :math:`I(V)` curves.

As the comparison of two curves is not an unambiguous task, multiple R factors implementations exist. The used R factor is chosen via the :ref:`R_FACTOR_TYPE<RFACTORTYPE>` parameter.
ViPErLEED supports Pendry' R factor :math:`R_P` :cite:p:`pendryReliabilityFactorsLEED1980` and :math:`R_2` :cite:p:`spornAccuracyQuantitativeLEED1998`.

-  :math:`R_P` compares the logarithmic derivatives of the :math:`I(V)` data, with a fix for the divergence of the logarithm when the intensity approaches zero.
-  :math:`R_2` is based on the mean-square difference of the (scaled) :math:`I(V)` curves.

.. note::
    Using :math:`R_P` is the **default setting** and highly encouraged since tests have shown that it leads to better results than :math:`R_2` :cite:p:`spornAccuracyQuantitativeLEED1998`.

The Pendry R factor
-------------------

The Pendry R factor :math:`R_P` can have values between 0 and 2 and is defined as follows :cite:p:`pendryReliabilityFactorsLEED1980,heinzElectronBasedMethods2013`:

.. math:: 
    R_{\mathrm{P}} = \frac{\sum_{h,k}\int (Y^\mathrm{theo}_{h,k}(E) - Y^\mathrm{exp}_{h,k}(E) )^2 dE }{\sum_{h,k}\int (Y^\mathrm{theo}_{h,k}(E)^2 + Y^\mathrm{exp}_{h,k}(E)^2) dE}

The R-factor can be calculated for all beams :math:`g` together or individually.
:math:`Y(E)` is the Pendry Y-function that contains the beam intensities :math:`I(E)`, the derivative :math:`I'(E)=\frac{dI{E}}{dE}`, and the imaginary part of the inner potential :math:`V_{0\text{i}}` (see parameter :ref:`V0_imag`).

.. math:: 
    Y(E) = \frac{I(E)/I'(E)}{[I(E)/I'(E)]^2 + V_{0\text{i}}^2}

:math:`R_P` becomes 0 in the case of perfect agreement between curves.
For uncorrelated data, :math:`R_P` = 1, while values larger than 1 indicate anti-correlation.
The best values of :math:`R_P` obtained by the Erlangen group **TODO Lutz, Tilman: hyperlink to group website?** are below 0.05. **TODO Lutz, Michael: citation*?**
For close-packed surfaces, values above 0.2 indicate a problem such as an incorrect structure model.
R factors for more open surfaces, such as missing-row-reconstructed Pt(110), can be higher than 0.2.

Note that some smoothing algorithms applied to both, the experimental and the calculated data, such as the smoothing suggested by Pendry in :cite:p:`pendryReliabilityFactorsLEED1980`, apparently lowers the R factor, because it effectively raises the minima of the :math:`I(V)` curves.
At minima, where the intensities approach zero, :math:`R_P` is especially 
sensitive to small differences; artificially increasing the intensity there leads to lower values of :math:`R_P`.
Some LEED programs apply such a smoothing; in this case lower R factors than those obtained with ViPErLEED will be reported, but this does not indicate a better agreement between calculated and experimental data. 
The ViPErLEED package uses only smoothing of the experimental :math:`I(V)` curves to suppress noise; the smoothing algorithm employed does not raise the minima. **TODO Michael, Michele, Alex: comment by Ulli: say which smoothing algorithm is used?**

Smoothing of the experimental data should be done by the :math:`I(V)` curve editor in the Spot Tracker package;
its output should be used as :ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv<EXPBEAMS>` file.
By default, ViPErLEED applies no additional smoothing upon structure optimization and calculating the R factor.
(Using the :ref:`R_FACTOR_SMOOTH<RFACTORSMOOTH>` parameter for smoothing the experimental :math:`I(V)` curves is discouraged; the smoothing algorithm applied there is inferior to that used by the :math:`I(V)` curve editor.)
