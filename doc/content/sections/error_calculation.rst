Error calculations
==================

Once a best-fit structure has been determined, it is useful to see how 
strongly small changes to specific parameters affect the R-factor. 
In the error calculation, displacements (given by the :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<DISPLACEMENTS>`) are applied to one parameter at a time, and the R-factor is output for each step of the variation range.
If multiple parameters are linked (e.g. by symmetry), these parameters are treated as one, and varied together.

To run the error calculation, set :ref:`RUN<run>` as ``RUN = 5`` in the 
:ref:`PARAMETERS<PARAMETERS>` file. It is recommended to first run a 
reference calculation in the same run (e.g. ``RUN = 1 5``), 
as the error curves may not be centered otherwise.

Required input files are the same as for running delta calculations and a search, 
i.e. the structural input files, :ref:`experimental beams<EXPBEAMS>`, 
a set of :ref:`Tensors<Tensorszip>` from a reference calculation, and a 
:ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<DISPLACEMENTS>` defining what parameters should be varied.
Note that defining multiple search sections in the :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<DISPLACEMENTS>`, 
as is possible for the search, is not allowed here:
Instead, only the first search section of the :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<DISPLACEMENTS>` 
will be read (or the last, if the error calculation is run following a search).
Defining geometrical, vibrational and occupation variations all in the same 
:ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<DISPLACEMENTS>` is allowed, but the different 
variations will be split up, so the result is the same as executing 
multiple error calculations.
This means, you cannot have error calculations for multiple geometrical displacement directions (e.g. :math:`x` *and* :math:`z`) at the same time since this would require multiple consecutive search sections in the DISPLACEMENTS file.

The error calculation does *not* require a set of :ref:`Delta files<Deltaszip>`, 
since the normal delta calculation routines mix geometrical and vibrational 
displacements. Instead, the error calculation will run the required delta 
calculations automatically, splitting the geometrical and vibrational 
variations into separate delta files to reduce computational cost.

The results of the error calculation will be output into the files :ref:`Errors.pdf and Errors.csv<errorspdf>`.

.. note::

    -  If you find that the R factor is very insensitive to the displacement 
       of a given atom (much less sensitivity than for other atoms with a 
       similar depth and similar scattering properties), 
       this is an indication that the respective atom is either absent or 
       its position is **far** from the true position.
       In this case, you may want to consider increasing the displacement range
       for this atom. Note also the what is "far away" depends on how strongly the
       atom scatters (i.e. chemical species and depth), and in some cases may be
       as small as 0.1Ã…, e.g. for a z variation of a surface atom.

    -  Hydrogen is a very weak scatterer; the R factor depends only weakly on its position.
    -  If a site can be occupied by different chemical elements, the site 
       occupation (i.e., the element concentrations) and vibration amplitude 
       can be strongly correlated :cite:p:`blumSegregationOrderingFe12001`.
       In such a case, the increase of the R factor when changing one of 
       these parameters is not a good indication for the error of that parameter.
    -  Simultaneous geometrical/vibrational variation of multiple chemical elements occupying the same site is possible, and the displacement ranges for the different elements may differ.
       However, all displacement ranges must have the same length.
