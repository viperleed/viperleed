Structure search
================

The structure search (referred to as ``search`` in the code) is
the third part of a :ref:`Tensor LEED<tensor_leed>` calculation as 
implemented in ViPErLEED (:ref:`RUN<run>` = 3).
It must follow a :ref:`reference calculation<ref-calc>` and a
:ref:`delta amplitude calculation<sec_deltas>` and requires stored
:ref:`delta files<deltaszip>` to run.
In almost all cases it is the most computationally expensive part of the
calculation to run. The complexity depends on the size of the
parameter space defined in the :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<displacements>`.

During the structure search, the optimization algorithm (see
Ref.Â :cite:p:`kottckeNewApproachAutomated1997`) samples surface structures
in the configuration-space defined in :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS<displacements>`.
Diffraction intensities and a corresponding |R factor| are calculated for 
these structures based on combinations of the pre-computed delta-amplitudes.
The optimization tries to find the combination of parameters yielding the
lowest possible |R factor|.

The behavior of the structure optimization algorithm is affected by multiple
parameters (see :ref:`search behaviour<search_settings>`). For details on the
available options for geometrical, vibrational and occupational displacement
vectors see the entry on the :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<displacements>`.
There are some caveats to the structure optimization in tensor LEED in general
and the implementation in TensErLEED in particular.
See :ref:`the section on structure search in tensor leed<tensor_leed_search>`
for details.


Structure search in ViPErLEED
=============================

The structure search in ViPErLEED is based on the structure search section of
TensErLEED, though as with the other sections, ViPErLEED takes care of handling
the input and output for the legacy code. The search is also the only part of
ViPErLEED and TensErLEED that makes use of processes communicating via
:term:`MPI`, if available (highly recommended). When a structure search is
executed in ViPErLEED the following main steps are performed before the actual
calculation starts:

#.  The :ref:`file DISPLACEMENTS<displacements>` is read and interpreted.
#.  The current :ref:`delta files<deltaszip>` are loaded and checked for
    compatibility.
#.  ViPErLEED generates and writes the TensErLEED inpute files
    ``rf.info``, ``PARAM`` and ``search.steu`` based on the slab
    and :ref:`EXPBEAMS file<expbeams>`.
#.  Based on the slab symmetry and the
    :ref:`symmetry settings<symmetry_settings>`, ViPErLEED determines the
    symmetry-linked parameters and writes the parameter-space input file
    control.chem.
#.  ViPErLEED will then, based on :ref:`N_CORES<ncores>` and the presence
    of ``mpirun`` fetch the corresponding TensErLEED source code files and
    compile them **at run-time**. **Note** that this will require the
    pre-compiled object files :ref:`random_.o or MPIrandom_.o<mpirandom>`
    to be present.
    See the :ref:`installation section<installation>` for details.
#.  The :ref:`search log file<log_files>` ``search-$timestamp`` is created
    and will be filled with progress information as the search continues.

With the preparation finished, the search is now executed (via ``mpirun`` if
available). Trial surface structures will be sampled using the algorithm
described by :cite:t:`kottckeNewApproachAutomated1997`, with a starting
configuration as defined by :ref:`SEARCH_START<searchstart>` and
:ref:`SEARCH_POPULATION<searchpop>` parallel trial individuals. See also
the section on the
:ref:`optimization algorithm used in ViPErLEED<optimization_algorithm>`.

ViPErLEED periodically monitors the search progress by reading the
:ref:`SDTL<sdtl>` file and will report on the current best |R factor|
and the amount of sampled structures.
From this information, the files :ref:`search-progress.pdf<searchprogresspdf>`
and :ref:`search-report.pdf<searchreportpdf>` will be generated and updated,
which provides a graphical overview of the structure search progress and
convergence. :ref:`search-progress.pdf<searchprogresspdf>` contains information
related exclusively to the current TensErLEED structure-optimization, i.e., one
block in the :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<displacements>`. ViPErLEED enables the
user to chain and/or loop multiple TensErLEED structure-optimizations (see the
:ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<displacements>` syntax for details). In that case,
:ref:`search-report.pdf<searchreportpdf>` summarizes the overall progress
over all optimization runs.

Once all required convergence criteria are met, the search will
be cleanly aborted, the resulting files will be processed and
:ref:`search-progress.pdf<searchprogresspdf>` and
:ref:`search-report.pdf<searchreportpdf>` will be updated one
last time with the final values. After this, the structure-search
section is finished and ViPErLEED will continue with the next
section as defined in the :ref:`RUN parameter<run>` (or stop
if there are none).

.. warning::
  **Remember** to call the :ref:`bookkeeper utility<bookkeeper>` with
  the ``-c`` flag after a ViPErLEED run containing a structure search,
  if you want to continue from the found best-fit structure.
  **Otherwise the progress will be discarded** and following
  runs will start again from the refercence structure, unless
  :ref:`POSCAR<poscar>` and :ref:`VIBROCC<vibrocc>` are
  manually copied from the ``OUT`` directory.
