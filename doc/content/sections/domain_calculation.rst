Domain calculations
===================

If multiple structures coexist on the sample, then the experimental beams are a superposition from the beam sets diffracted from each of the different structural domains. This means that the different structures must be optimized at the same time to optimize the R-factor between theoretical and experimental I(V)-curves.
This page covers how the input file structure for ViPErLEED changes when domains are present.

While domain calculations can be run from scratch (i.e. including the reference calculations) from two sets of input files, a way to get more user control is to first execute reference calculations separately for the different structures, then start the domain calculation from the Tensors.zip files from those pre-calculations.
This way, you can convince yourself that initializations have run correctly, that the detected symmetries are sensible, that the theoretical beam sets for the different domains are as expected, etc., before launching into the simultaneous optimization of the structures.

Note that TensErLEED requires the different structures to be calculated on the same surface supercell, i.e. with the same unit cell in the :ref:`POSCAR file<POSCAR>`, and the same :ref:`SUPERLATTICE<SUPERLATTICE>` parameter for each domain.
Since changing the unit cell size may change the detected symmetry, the :ref:`SYMMETRY_CELL_TRANSFORM<SYMMETRY_CELL_TRANSFORM>`  parameter allows defining a base unit cell and linking redundant atoms by translational symmetry.

In addition to the surface unit cell and :ref:`the SUPERLATTICE parameter<SUPERLATTICE>`, the following settings must also be the same in each of the reference calculations (it is recommended to fix the :ref:`PARAMETERS<PARAMETERS>` explicitly):

-  :ref:`THEO_ENERGIES<theo_energies>` 
-  :ref:`LMAX<LMAX>` 
-  :ref:`BEAM_INCIDENCE<BEAMINCIDENCE>` 
-  :ref:`IVBEAMS<IVBEAMS>` 

Running the domain calculations
-------------------------------

To execute a domain calculation, set up a base folder containing all the normal input files, except for the ones specifically concerned with the structures, i.e. **without** POSCAR and VIBROCC. Likewise, the PARAMETERS file should contain **no** parameters concerned with interpretation of POSCAR or VIBROCC, such as e.g. :ref:`BULK_REPEAT<BULK_REPEAT>`, :ref:`ELEMENT_MIX<ELSPLIT>`, :ref:`SITE_DEF<SITEDEF>`, etc.; if any such parameters are present, they will be ignored here.
Finally, **do** define the :ref:`DOMAIN<DOMAIN>` parameter in the PARAMETERS file once for each domain that should be included.
The DOMAIN parameter can point to an absolute or relative path from which the input data for a given domain should be fetched; input data can be a complete Tensors.zip file, or the path can point to a folder containing the usual input files for a reference calculation.
If the target path is a directory in which previous ViPErLEED calculations have been executed, the program will check whether there is a Tensors folder and fetch the highest-number Tensors.zip file.
For more information, see the :ref:`DOMAIN<DOMAIN>`  page. Use the :ref:`DOMAIN_STEP<DOMAIN_STEP>`  parameter to define the step width for domain area variations.

Then, run the :ref:`job script<job_script>`. A subfolder will be created for each domain, in which the input files will be placed.
All structure-specific output files (e.g. POSCAR_OUT, VIBROCC_OUT) will go to these subfolders, *not* the original paths from which the inputs were fetched; output concerning all domains taken together will go to the main folder (e.g. the :ref:`Search-progress.pdf<searchprogresspdf>` file and :ref:`Rfactor plots<Rfactorplots>`  after the Superpos calculation).

To specify which segments should be run, either use the :ref:`RUN<RUN>`  parameter as usual, or set ``RUN = 4`` as a shorthand for a domain calculation. This will be interpreted as ``RUN = 1-3`` or ``RUN = 2-3``, depending on whether the input files are compatible Tensors.zip files or whether a reference calculation is needed. For ``RUN = 4``, reference calculations will only be executed for the domains that need them; specify ``RUN = 1-3`` explicitly to re-run reference calculations for all domains.
However, as discussed above, it is recommended you run the reference calculations separately beforehand for better control, and specify ``RUN = 2-3`` explicitly here.

.. warning:: 
  In the current version, automatic cleanup after domain calculations is implemented only rudimentarily.
  Domain-specific output files are not copied out from the work folder, and the bookkeeper ``--cont`` functionality will not work.

The DISPLACEMENTS file for domains
----------------------------------

Instead of specifying :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS<DISPLACEMENTS>`  in each of the input subfolders, DISPLACEMENTS are defined in the main folder for all domains. The syntax is similar to the way consecutive searches are specified, with an extra header line specifying which domain is being addressed, e.g. for a calculation with two domains called ``1x1`` and ``2x1``:

::

   == SEARCH z

     == DOMAIN 1x1
    
       = GEO_DELTA
       * L(1) z = -0.1 0.1 0.02
       * L(2) z = -0.05 0.05 0.025

     == DOMAIN 2x1

       = GEO_DELTA
       * L(1-2) z = -0.1 0.1 0.02
       * L(3) z = -0.05 0.05 0.025
