ViPErLEED work segments
-----------------------

ViPErLEED operates using a set of self-contained work segments (see also the :ref:`RUN<RUN>`  parameter). 
The three main segments, following the logic of calculations using the Tensor LEED approximation, are:

#. :ref:`Reference calculation<ref-calc>`: Full-dynamic LEED calculation, 
   which outputs a set of :ref:`theoretical beams<THEOBEAMS>` for a 
   given structure and :ref:`the "Tensors"<Tensorszip>` 
#. :ref:`Delta-amplitudes generation<sec_deltas>`: 
   The delta-amplitudes specify how parameter changes affect the scattering amplitudes within the :ref:`tensor-LEED approximation<tensor_leed>`.
   This calculation is based on the tensors and a 
   :ref:`set of parameter variations specified by the user<DISPLACEMENTS>`, 
   produces :ref:`"Delta files"<Deltaszip>`.
#. :ref:`Search<sec_search>`: Using the :ref:`Delta files<Deltaszip>`  to vary the theoretical beams, looks for a set of parameters such that the :ref:`R-factor<r-factor_calculation>` between the theoretical beams and :ref:`a given set of experimental beams<EXPBEAMS>` is minimized.

Which of these segments should be executed must be specified using the :ref:`RUN<RUN>`  parameter, using the segment numbers in the list above.
Besides these main three segments, there are also the following minor segments, which will be inserted automatically during normal ViPErLEED execution when appropriate:

-  :ref:`Initialization<initialization>`: Always runs at the beginning; reads and checks input files, runs symmetry search, generates derived input files if appropriate.
-  :ref:`Superpos calculation<super_pos>`: Automatically runs after the search. Generates a set of theoretical beams for the actual best fit configuration based on the Tensor LEED approximation,
-  :ref:`R-factor calculation<r-factor_calculation>`: Automatically runs after the :ref:`reference calculation<ref-calc>`  and superpos segments, if an :ref:`experimental beams file<EXPBEAMS>` is present.
   Calculates the R-factor per beam and for the entire set of beams, and outputs an :ref:`Rfactor_plots pdf file<Rfactorplots>`.

Further specialized segments include:

-  :ref:`Error calculations<error_calculation>`: Based on a given reference structure (i.e. after a reference calculation has been run), calculate one-dimensional error curves for variation of a single parameter. Effectively, this calculates delta amplitudes for variations of a single parameter, and outputs the R-factor for every single configuration along that axis.
-  :ref:`Full-dynamic optimization<fdoptimization>`: Optimize parameters that cannot be varied during the search, like :ref:`BEAM_INCIDENCE<BEAMINCIDENCE>`, :ref:`V0_IMAG<v0_imag>`  or unit cell scaling. This is achieved by performing multiple full-dynamic (i.e. "reference") calculations (without Tensor output). The behavior is controlled by the :ref:`OPTIMIZE<OPTIMIZE>` parameter.

The pages listed above cover normal operation, in which the theoretical beams correspond to only one surface structure.
If multiple structures coexist on the sample, the same segments need to be executed, but their behavior is somewhat different, as described here:

-  :ref:`Domain calculations<domain_calculation>`: Reference calculations are run separately for the different domains (if necessary) and Delta-amplitudes are generated independently.
The search then combines the optimization of the different structures – weighted by their area fraction – for the best overall R-factor, compared to the experimental beam set.
