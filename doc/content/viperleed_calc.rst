``viperleed calc`` is the Python package that makes up the core of the
computational part of the ViPErLEED project. It provides a set of tools for
calculating and analyzing LEED-I(V) curves for arbitrary input structures.

It is available from the Python Package Index (PyPI) and can easily be installed
using pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install viperleed

The ``viperleed calc`` package is written in Python, but many core parts require
the :term:`TensErLEED` source code to be available which is available
from the
`ViPErLEED GitHub repository <https://github.com/viperleed/viperleed>`__.
Please see the :ref:`installation page<installation>` for further information.

Stand-alone calculations with ``viperleed calc`` can be executed using the
command line interface (see :ref:`here<how_to_run>`).

An interface to the Atomic Simulation Environment (:term:`ASE`) is
:ref:`also available<aseapi>`.


.. todo: Mention you can import the package and use it in your own code.
