|LEED-IV| measurements
======================

|LEED-IV| measurements are the core functionality of the ViPErLEED measurement
package. Before performing such a measurement, make sure you have followed all
steps described in :ref:`Best Practice <best_practice>` to ensure high data
quality and to reduce acquisition time.

A |LEED-IV| measurement requires a camera for operation. A controller capable
of measuring the beam current is strongly recommended, as it allows the
acquired data to be normalized.
