===========================
Download ViPErLEED Firmware
===========================

Firmware for the ViPErLEED hardware controller is provided through our firmware
`repository <https://github.com/viperleed>`__.
(TODO: replace this link with the dedicated firmware repository URL once available)
Download the desired firmware release and place the downloaded firmware in its
zipped form inside the **Firmware** directory that you configured in the
:ref:`System settings <setup_measurements>`.

This directory will be searched automatically by the firmware upload tool
inside the ViPErLEED measurement GUI.
