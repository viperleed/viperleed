Quantities
==========

Currents
========

|I0b| **/ Beam current**: The current emitted by the electron gun.

**Sample current**: The beam current arriving at the sample. The sample must be
biased to prevent secondary electron emission.

Energies
========

**Beam energy**: The kinetic energy of the electron beam directed at the
sample, determined by the acceleration voltage.

**Start energy**: The beam energy at which the measurement begins.

**Delta energy / ΔE**: The energy difference between two consecutively acquired
energies. In other words, the step height between energy points.

**End energy**: The final beam energy of the measurement, after which the
acquisition either concludes or restarts.

Times
=====

**HV settle time / Energy settle time**: The duration of the transient response
of the acceleration voltage after setting a new energy.

|I0b| **settle time / Current settle time**: The duration of the transient
response of the beam current after setting a new energy.
