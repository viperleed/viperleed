Example System: Cu(111)-Te ad-chains
====================================

The following example covers a ViPErLEED analysis and structure optimization
for a copper telluride layer on Cu(111) based on the paper by
:cite:t:`kisslingerSubmonolayerCopperTelluride2021`. The experimental data and
the outline for the analysis steps described below were provided by the authors
of the publication.
This system deals with a :math:`(5\times \sqrt{3})_{\text{rect}}`
superstructure and has 10 atoms per bulk layer. It serves as an example for how
a more challenging system can be treated with ViPErLEED. In fact, the analysis
presented in the original publication was performed using an early development
version of ViPErLEED :cite:p:`kisslingerSubmonolayerCopperTelluride2021`.

Introduction
============

The system we are analyzing is a :math:`(5\times \sqrt{3})_{\text{rect}}`
superstructure of copper telluride on the hexagonal Cu(111) substrate.
The tellurium coverage is 0.40 monolayers, which corresponds to 4 tellurium
atoms per surface unit cell.

From experiments, we have a set of 79 beams in our energy range (20 to 500eV)
– stored in the file :ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv<expbeams>`. These beams correspond to
a total energy range of around 17500 eV, of which only around 1800 eV are from
integer beams. :numref:`Cu(111)-Te_LEED_pattern` shows a Snapshot of the
experimental LEED pattern.

For our example analysis we start from a qualitatively correct structure
model (:ref:`POSCAR file<poscar>`) with correct layer stacking
:cite:p:`kisslingerSubmonolayerCopperTelluride2021`.
However, the initial atom positions in the POSCAR are taken from bulk Cu,
so we need to expect significant relaxation during the structure-optimization.
Below, you see a rendering of the initial structure (produced using
:term:`VESTA` :cite:p:`mommaVESTAThreedimensionalVisualization2011`).

   We will need to run multiple delta-amplitude calculations and structure
   optimizations. The individual :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS files<displacements>`
   are not all shown in full below, but you can download all input files
   :download:`here</_static/example_systems/Cu(111)-Te/input_files.zip>`.

PARAMETERS
==========

Similar to the previous examples, we start by
setting up a :ref:`PARAMETERS file<parameters>`:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Cu(111)-Te/PARAMETERS
   :language: console
   :caption: PARAMETERS

Most of the parameters set in this file have been explained in
:ref:`previous examples<example_ag_100>`, so will skip some details
here. Worth mentioning in this particular case is that we use
:ref:`SITE_DEF<sitedef>` to define the two topmost copper and
tellurium atoms as explicit surface sites. We are further using
the :ref:`SUPERLATTICE parameter<superlattice>` to manually define
the surface superlattice type and orientation (to match the
convention used in :ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv<expbeams>`).

As usual,the :ref:`IVBEAMS<ivbeams>` and :ref:`PHASESHIFTS<phaseshifts>`
files are generated automatically during initialization (:ref:`RUN = 0<run>`).
The :ref:`VIBROCC file<vibrocc>` will also be generated by ViPErLEED based on
the provided parameters :ref:`T_DEBYE<t_debye>`,
:ref:`T_EXPERIMENT<t_experiment>`, and :ref:`VIBR_AMP_SCALE<VIBR_AMP_SCALE>`.

Rough DISPLACEMENTS
===================

For the delta-amplitudes calculation and the structure optimization
(:ref:`RUN = 1-3<run>`), we will start out with a very rough grid of
geometric optimizations (:ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<displacements>`).
As is generally recommended, we start with optimizations normal to the
surface (:math:`z`). Immediately following that comes an in-plane
optimization. Due to the complex structure, one in-plane direction
is not sufficient, and we need to run an optimization in (:math:`x`)
*and* (:math:`y`) direction. For details on the used syntax, see the
entry on the :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<displacements>`.


.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Cu(111)-Te/DISPLACEMENTS_rough_1
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS (30 pm range)

.. note::
    Note that we allow displacements of up to 0.3 Å for tellurium to speed up
    the convergence in this example. Normally, this is not recommended,
    because :ref:`tensor LEED approximation<tensor_leed>` will lead to
    substation errors for displacement of 0.3 Å.

As usual, we can see a visualization of the optimization convergence in the
file :ref:`Search-report.pdf<searchreportpdf>` in the ``OUT`` directory.
:numref:`Cu(111)-Te_search_report` shows the first page output of
:ref:`Search-report.pdf<searchreportpdf>`. The upper figure shows the R factor
as a function of the search progress (search generations). The lower figure
shows the deviation of the structural parameters over time.
Together, these two plots give an idea, of how converged the search is.

.. _Cu(111)-Te_search_report:
.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Cu(111)-Te/figures/Search-report_rough.svg
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

   First page of the file :ref:`Search-report.pdf<searchreportpdf>` produced
   for the first (rough) structure-optimization.

The initial reference-calculation yields an
:ref:`R-factor<r-factor_calculation>` :math:`R_P \approx 0.82` since
our starting configuration is very far from the ideal positions.
Over this rough optimization, where parameter values are shifted by up
to 0.24 Å compared to the initial model (this is a lot !), the R-factor
quickly drops to :math:`R_P \approx 0.47`. This is still quite poor,
but the progress is encouraging.

Remember to keep the best fit-structure by calling the
:ref:`bookkeeper utility<bookkeeper>` with the ``--cont``
flag before proceeding:

    .. code-block:: console

        $ python3 bookkeeper.py --cont #[or ./bookkeeper --cont]

Once we run the next reference-calculation, we notice that we
get an R factor of :math:`R_P \approx 0.33`, even though we
got :math:`R_P \approx 0.47` at the end of the previous run
– **a big difference**! This comes from the mentioned **Tensor LEED error**.

Fine DISPLACEMENTS and Search Parameters
========================================

Since in the former fit no parameter value reached the edge of the respective
variation range, we should follow up by running a second, less coarse,
optimization. For this stage, a choice of 10 pm range with 1 pm steps
(0.1 Å range with 0.01 Å steps) should be reasonable:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Cu(111)-Te/DISPLACEMENTS_rough_2
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS (0.1 Å range)

.. hint::
    In preparing this example we found that the default search parameters
    lead to rather slow convergence in this and the following steps. To
    speed up the process, we recommend using these settings for
    :ref:`SEARCH_START<searchstart>` and
    :ref:`SEARCH_CONVERGENCE<search_convergence>`
    (simply append the lines to PARAMETERS):

        .. code-block:: console

            SEARCH_START = centered
            SEARCH_CONVERGENCE gaussian = 0.05 0.5
            SEARCH_CONVERGENCE dgen dec = 50 1.5

   After the previous search steps, the parameters are close to the optimum.
   Therefore, the danger of getting trapped in a local R-factor minimum close
   to the starting position is low, and we can initialize the search at the
   previously determined values.
   The :ref:`SEARCH_CONVERGENCE<search_convergence>` dgen parameter ensures
   that the search range shrinks more rapidly than with standard parameters.


The optimization on the 1 pm (0.01 Å) grid allows us to further reduce the
R-factor to about :math:`R_P \approx 0.23`, which is again a good improvement
on the previous value of :math:`R_P \approx 0.33`.

Full-dynamic Optimization
=========================

If we now visually compare experimental with calculated |IV| curves, we already
notice a good qualitative agreement. However, we find that the peak widths in
the experimental dataset seem to be consistently narrower than in our
calculation. This is generally a sign that the imaginary part of the
inner potential (:math:`V_{0\text{i}}`) of our calculation is off.
To be more precise, :math:`V_{0\text{i}}` is likely too large, as
higher :math:`V_{0\text{i}}` increases peak-widths and smoothens out
the curves.

:math:`V_{0\text{i}}` strongly affects the R-factor, but is hard to estimate
for an unknown system. Since we didn't specify a value for
:math:`V_{0\text{i}}` in PARAMETERS, ViPErLEED took the default value of
4.5 eV (see :ref:`V0_IMAG<v0_imag>`). The parameter :math:`V_{0\text{i}}`
is not accessible in the tensor LEED approximation, but we can use a
:ref:`full-dynamic optimization<fdoptimization>` to find an optimal value.
To do this, we set :ref:`RUN = 6<run>` and add this line to
:ref:`PARAMETERS<parameters>`:

.. code-block:: console

    OPTIMIZE V0i = step 0.5

.. warning::
    Always make sure that the optimized value used for :math:`V_{0\text{i}}`
    is (i) reasonable (:math:`V_{0\text{i}} \lesssim 7 \text{eV}`),
    (ii) forms an actual minimum, and (iii) gives qualitatively correct
    |IV| curves.

    Since higher :math:`V_{0\text{i}}` smoothens out the |IV| curves, it is
    possible to deceptively decrease the R factor by arbitrarily increasing
    :math:`V_{0\text{i}}`. This usually happens in cases of very high R-factor
    values, where :math:`V_{0\text{i}}` optimization is not the main concern
    anyhow.

   :align: center

   :math:`V_{0\text{i}}`.

The optimized value for :math:`V_{0\text{i}}` will be output in the log
file and automatically added to the :ref:`PARAMETERS file<parameters>`
for subsequent runs. Furthermore, ViPErLEED produces the files
:ref:`FD_Optimization_beams.pdf<fdoptimizationbeams>` and
:ref:`FD_Optimization.pdf<fdoptimizationdata>` in the ``OUT`` directory.
:ref:`FD_Optimization_beams.pdf<fdoptimizationbeams>` shows the calculated
diffraction intensities for different values of the optimized parameter,
while :ref:`FD_Optimization.pdf<fdoptimizationdata>` shows the R factors
corresponding to each trial value.

   :math:`V_{0\text{i}}` on the :math:`(1|0)` beam. Note that
   the :math:`V_{0i}` variation only leads to minor changes of
   the spectral appearance.

Refined structure fit
=====================

As usual, we can now perform some final structure fits with a fine-grained
(sub pm steps) grid. In particular, we should also optimize the
**vibrational amplitudes**, which we have skipped so far. We recommend
starting with the vibrational amplitudes here, since we have not touched
them at all in the previous optimization step:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Cu(111)-Te/DISPLACEMENTS_fine_1
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS (0.5 pm range)

You may want to finish up with a last "fine-tuning" of the vibrational
amplitudes and (:math:`z`) positions. See e.g. file ``DISPLACEMENTS_fine_2``
in the input files, but feel free to play around with the setting yourself,
to get a feeling for the available options. Altogether, this should bring
us to an R-factor :math:`R_P \approx 0.19`, which is already a good agreement
for such a heavily corrugated surface, details see discussion in
Ref. :cite:p:`kisslingerSubmonolayerCopperTelluride2021`.

Error calculation
=================

We can also perform an error calculation for this system to gauge how
sensitive our result is to minor changes of structural parameters.
For this, we need to set up a :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<displacements>`
specifying the requested steps. Here is an example for displacements
in (:math:`x`) direction, but example for (:math:`y`), (:math:`z`)
and vibrational amplitudes are provided in the
:download:`input files</_static/example_systems/Cu(111)-Te/input_files.zip>`
as well:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Cu(111)-Te/DISPLACEMENTS_errors_x
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS for error calculation in x direction

The results are plotted in the file :ref:`Errors.pdf<errorspdf>`.
We see that displacements for atoms in all layers have a drastic impact on
the R-factor – so we can be fairly confident that all varied atoms are indeed
present within the true surface structure.
