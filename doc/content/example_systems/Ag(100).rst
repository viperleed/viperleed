Introduction
============

Our starting point for this example is:

-  We have experimental |LEED-IV| curves for our surface taken at normal
   incidence, saved in file :ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv<expbeams>`.
-  We would like to compare these intensities with a Ag(100)-(1×1) surface
   that was handmade from the bulk crystal structure. It is stored as a
   :ref:`POSCAR file<poscar>` (see :ref:`below<ag_init>`).

In this example, we want to set up a ViPErLEED calculation and structure
optimization based on these inputs alone.
Our goal is to get the lowest possible |R factor| starting from this reference
structure.
If we manage to get a good agreement between the experimental and calculated
curves, we can be confident that our structure model is correct.

We will start off by setting up our input files and running an
:ref:`initialization<initialization>` to check for any errors in them.
Then, we run a :ref:`reference calculation<ref-calc>` to get some initial
calculated results.
Afterwards, we perform a :ref:`delta-amplitudes<sec_deltas>` calculation and
:ref:`structure search<sec_search>` to refine the results.

.. _ag_init:

Initialization run and generation of phase shifts
=================================================

To start off, we place the files :ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv<expbeams>` and
:ref:`POSCAR<poscar>` in our source directory.
Both files have defined formats.

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Ag(100)/POSCAR
   :language: console
   :caption: POSCAR file containing the initial structure.

We then create a :ref:`PARAMETERS file<parameters>` which tells ViPErLEED what
to do

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Ag(100)/PARAMETERS
   :language: console
   :caption: PARAMETERS file for the initial reference calculation

GLOBAL PARAMETERS
   Since we only want to run the :ref:`initialization<initialization>` for now,
   we set :ref:`RUN = 0<run>`. For this example, we also limit our energy range
   to 45–700 eV, with an energy step of 3 eV
   (\ :ref:`THEO_ENERGIES<theo_energies>`).

PARAMETERS FOR INTERPRETING POSCAR
   We then tell ViPErLEED how to interpret the structure given in the
   :ref:`POSCAR file<poscar>`.
   Using the :ref:`BULK_LIKE_BELOW` parameter, we specify that below
   0.45 (unit-cell fraction along :math:`\mathbf{c}`) the given structure
   is bulklike.

   With the :ref:`SITE_DEF<sitedef>` command, we further define that the first
   atom in the POSCAR file (here the topmost atom) should be treated as a
   distinct species. See the page on the :ref:`SITE_DEF<sitedef>` parameter
   for details on how this works, and see also the notes on
   :ref:`element names<elementnamecollision>`.

   .. hint::
       Instead of ``SITE_DEF Ag = surf 1``, we could also set
       ``SITE_DEF Ag = surf top(1)`` to select the topmost silver atom,
       irrespective of the order in the POSCAR.

PARAMETERS FOR VIBROCC
   In addition to the atomic positions, the calculation of scattering
   intensities also requires vibrational amplitudes for every atom in
   the unit cell.
   While the atomic positions are contained in the :ref:`POSCAR file<poscar>`,
   the vibrational amplitudes are given in the :ref:`VIBROCC file<vibrocc>`.
   However, rather than writing the :ref:`VIBROCC file<vibrocc>` ourselves,
   we can also let ViPErLEED calculate bulk vibrational amplitudes by providing
   the :ref:`T_DEBYE<t_debye>` and :ref:`T_EXPERIMENT<t_experiment>`
   parameters. By further providing :ref:`VIBR_AMP_SCALE<VIBR_AMP_SCALE>`,
   we guess the vibrational amplitudes for the surface atoms.
   The VIBR_AMP_SCALE assignment means that all atoms defined as ``surf`` (via
   SITE_DEF) have vibration amplitudes 1.3 times higher than those calculated
   from the Debye temperature. All other atoms, who are implicitly assigned a
   ``def`` tag, will be given vibrational amplitudes
   :ref:`determined <vibrocc_auto>` from the Debye temperature.


That's all the input we need to start the initialization run.

.. todo::
   Insert an example command for how to start the calculation here.

Once the run finishes, we can have a look at the
:ref:`log file<log_files_calc>` to see if everything went as expected.
Unless there was some configuration error, the log should now contain lines
like this:

.. code-block:: console

   ...
   Found unit cell type: square
   Starting symmetry search...
   Found plane group: p4m
   Checking bulk unit cell...
   Found SUPERLATTICE = (1x1)
   ...

As expected, ViPErLEED recognized our surface be of p4m symmetry with a simple
:math:`(1 \times 1)` termination.

During the initialization, ViPErLEED also automatically calculated
electron-scattering phase shifts (based on atomic species and positions)
to be used as input for the following calculations.
They are stored in the :ref:`PHASESHIFTS file<phaseshifts>` that was copied
into the source directory.
This format, however, is hard to interpret for a human reader.
Instead we can look at a plotted version of the same data in the file
:ref:`Phaseshifts_plots.pdf<phaseshiftplots>` in the ``SUPP`` subdirectory.
The first page shows the energy-dependent phase shifts for the surface atom
is shown in :numref:`fig_ag_phaseshifts`.

.. _fig_ag_phaseshifts:
.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Ag(100)/phaseshifts_plots.png
   :width: 450px
   :align: center

   First page of the ``Phaseshifts_plots.pdf`` file for Ag(100)-(1×1).

The second page shows the (rather similar) phase shifts for lower-lying
bulk atoms.


Reference calculation and *R* factor
====================================

In this simple case, we don't need any further settings to run the
:ref:`reference calculation<ref-calc>`. We can just invoke |calc|
again after setting :ref:`RUN = 1<run>` to select
the :ref:`reference calculation<ref-calc>` section.

Note that the initialization is automatically executed at the start
of every ViPErLEED run.
Similarly, if an :ref:`EXPBEAMS.csv files<expbeams>` is provided as is the
case here, the |R-factor| :ref:`calculation<r-factor_calculation>` is
automatically executed after each reference calculation. By
:ref:`default<r-factor_calculation>`, ViPErLEED uses the Pendry |R factor|.

Once the reference calculation finishes (only takes about 1 min with the
chosen settings) we find a result for the |R factor| at the very end of the
:ref:`log file<log_files_calc>`:

.. code-block:: console

   ...
   Total elapsed time: 50.78 seconds

   Executed segments: 0 1 11
   Final R (refcalc): 0.1732

Additionally, in the :ref:`OUT directory<dir_organization_output>`, we
find a file :ref:`THEOBEAMS.csv<theobeams>`, which contains the calculated
|IV| curves and a file :ref:`Rfactor_plots_refcalc.pdf<rfactorplots>`, in
which the experimental and calculated beams are plotted. An extract is shown
in :numref:`fig_ag_iv_plot`.

.. _fig_ag_iv_plot:
.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Ag(100)/refalc_result_plot.png
   :width: 450px
   :align: center

   First page of the ``Rfactor_plots_refcalc.pdf`` file, showing
   experimental (orange) and calculated (blue) |IV| curves for
   the first reference-calculation run for Ag(100)-(1×1).


The |IV| curves clearly show a good qualitative agreement, but the |R factor|
of :math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.17` is not great for such a simple system. We
therefore proceed to the :ref:`delta-amplitudes<sec_deltas>` calculation and
the :ref:`structure search<sec_search>`.

.. note::
   The :ref:`reference calculation<ref-calc>` also produces the
   :ref:`tensor files<tensorszip>` which are saved in the ``Tensors``
   directory.
   They are required as starting point for the delta-amplitude calculation
   and will be recognized automatically by ViPErLEED.

Delta amplitudes and structure search
=====================================

To improve our |R factor|, we can run a local structure optimization using the
:ref:`tensor-LEED approach<tensor_leed>`.
To do this in ViPErLEED, we run a :ref:`delta-amplitude<sec_deltas>`
calculation followed by a :ref:`structure search<sec_search>`.

First, however, we need to provide instructions about which parameters to
vary in the optimization. In ViPErLEED, we give this information in the
:ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<displacements>`:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Ag(100)/DISPLACEMENTS
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS

See the page on the :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<displacements>` for
details on the syntax.
Here, we allow the :math:`z` positions of all silver atoms in the first
four layers to vary by up to :math:`\pm 0.20` Å with a step-width of
:math:`0.01` Å.


After setting up the :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<displacements>`, we can
run the delta-amplitudes calculation and structure optimization
by setting :ref:`RUN = 2-3<run>` in :ref:`PARAMETERS<parameters>`.
For a large system, this step can take many hours to finish, but for our simple
system it only takes about 4 min to converge (using 10 CPU cores).
At the end, when we take another look at our :ref:`log file<log_files_calc>`,
we find that the |R factor| dropped significantly from
:math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.17` to :math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.095`.
That's not bad, but we can do a bit better.

Now that we found a better configuration, we can use the
:ref:`bookkeeper utility<bookkeeper>` with the ``--cont``
flag to keep the new configuration and use it as our new
starting point, overwriting the old POSCAR and VIBROCC files:

.. code-block:: console

   $ python3 bookkeeper.py --cont #[or ./bookkeeper --cont]

Starting from this configuration, let's optimize with a finer grid.
We change the DISPLACEMENTS accordingly:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Ag(100)/DISPLACEMENTS_fine
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS with a finer grid

Here we allow :math:`\pm 0.020` Å variation on a :math:`0.004` Å grid.
Additionally, we also allow the topmost atom to change its vibrational
amplitude.
This may not seem like much, but already gives :math:`11^5` grid
points (11 values for 5 varied parameters) and will take about three
times as long as the the last run.

.. important::
   Because we changed our reference structure, it is advisable to re-run
   starting with the reference calculation by setting :ref:`RUN = 1-3 1<run>`.
   Note that we also add a second reference calculation at the end.
   This will remove errors due to the
   :ref:`tensor-LEED approximation<tensor_leed>` from the final result.

Once finished, we get an |R factor| of :math:`R_\mathrm{P} = 0.0836`.
To visualize how our optimization went, we can also take a look at the
:ref:`Search-progress.pdf file<searchprogresspdf>` in the ``OUT`` directory.
The first page is shown in :numref:`fig_ag_search_progress`.

.. _fig_ag_search_progress:
.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Ag(100)/search_convergence_plot.png
   :width: 450px
   :align: center

   First page of the ``Search-progress.pdf`` file showing convergence of the
   structure search (top) and development of atomistic parameters (bottom).

The final result of the optimization (POSCAR with coordinates and VIBROCC
with vibrational amplitudes) are saved in the ``OUT`` directory. Interatomic
distances and angles can easily be measured in a visualization software such
as :term:`VESTA` :cite:p:`mommaVESTAThreedimensionalVisualization2011`.

Next steps
==========

Further optimizing the structure is possible, but not very instructive.
Instead we conclude this example by mentioning two other options on how
to proceed with the analysis.

For a more complicated system, it may not be clear which structure parameters
are most important.
In this case, we could run an :ref:`error calculation<error_calculation>`
that shows how much the displacement an individual atom impacts the
|R factor|. The error calculation also provides us with an estimate for the
statistical accuracy of the determined parameter values, for details see
:ref:`errorspdf`.

Alternatively, we could turn to a :ref:`full-dynamic optimization<fdoptimization>`
to also tackle parameters that are not accessible under the tensor-LEED
approximation such as |V0i|, the unit-cell dimensions (not relevant here,
as they are well known for Ag), or the incidence angle of the electron beam.
