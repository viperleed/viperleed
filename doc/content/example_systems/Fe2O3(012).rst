==================================
Example system: Fe₂O₃(1−102)-(1×1)
==================================

Hematite (\ :math:`\alpha\text{-Fe}_2\text{O}_3`) is one of the most common
naturally occurring iron oxides. Its surfaces are popular model systems for
(single-atom) catalysis
:cite:p:`kraushoferAtomicscaleStructureHematite2018,franceschiModelSystemPhotocatalysis2020`,
photocatalysis and the study of mineral–water interfaces.

The :math:`(1\bar{1}02)` surface (also referred to as :math:`(012)`, or r-cut)
exhibits two stable terminations under :term:`UHV` conditions: a stoichiometric
(1×1) bulk-truncated termination, and a reduced (2×1) reconstruction
:cite:p:`kraushoferAtomicscaleStructureHematite2018`.
Here we use the bulk-truncated (1×1) surface as an example system of a "medium
complexity" oxide surface and will compare experimental |LEED-IV| data with a
theory calculation in ViPErLEED.

All input files needed to follow along on your own machine can be found

.. tip::
   If you are new to ViPErLEED, check out :ref:`this tutorial<example_ag_100>`
   first, which explains how to set up a calculation in more detail.

.. note::
   If you want to follow along on your own machine, note that the calculation
   may take *a long time* to complete.
   On a modern 48-core machine, each looped structure-optimization took about
   6-10 hours to finish.

Introduction
============

To set up the calculation, we need to start from a structure model of the (1×1)
surface in the POSCAR format. We can easily build this ourselves from a
(:math:`\alpha \text{-Fe}_2\text{O}_3`) bulk structure.
For this example, we use the structure by
:cite:t:`maslenSynchrotronXrayStudy1994`, which can be found on the
`Crystallography Open Database (entry 2101167) <http://www.crystallography.net/cod/2101167.html>`_.

.. warning::
    Bulk structures can be found in various online databases, but you should be
    careful to choose a model with the correct **experimental** lattice
    parameters (as determined by :term:`XRD`).
    Lattice parameters from e.g. :term:`DFT` calculations may be off by ~1%,
    which will strongly affect the |R factor|.
    Lattice parameters are not accessible in the
    :ref:`tensor LEED approximation<tensor_leed>`, but they can be optimized in
    a :ref:`full-dynamic optimization<fdoptimization>`.

To go from the hexagonal bulk unit cell to the unit cell for the
:math:`(1\bar{1}02)` (r-cut) surface, we need to apply a suitable change of
basis:

.. math::
    (a', b', c') = (a,b,c) P

    P  = \frac{1}{3} \begin{pmatrix}
                        3 & 1  & 2 \\
                        0 & 2  & 4 \\
                        0 & -1 & 1
                     \end{pmatrix}

In :term:`VESTA`, you can do this by selecting "Edit" -> "Edit Data" ->
"Unit cell" -> "Transform". To avoid problems later on, it is useful to also
delete the unit cell symmetry at this point in "Edit" -> "Edit Data" ->
"Unit cell" -> "Remove symmetry". The unit cell transformation will also
introduce some duplicate atoms, which can be deleted using "Edit" ->
"Structure parameters" -> "Remove duplicate atoms".

To create a suitable surface slab (as expected by ViPErLEED), we can then
replicate the unit cell along :math:`\vec{c}` and (optionally) remove the
topmost layer to create a vacuum interface.
In VESTA you can do this similarly, by applying a transformation which
stretches the cell in the :math:`\vec{c}` direction, e.g.:

.. math::
    \begin{pmatrix}
      1 & 0 & 0 \\
      0 & 1 & 0 \\
      0 & 0 & 2
    \end{pmatrix}

You may have to use the "Initialize current matrix" button first to apply
the transformation to the previously transformed unit cell. When applying
the transformation, VESTA may prompt you and ask what to do with the atoms
in the new unit cell.
Make sure to choose
*"Search atoms in the new unit-cell and add them as new sites"*.
You can then add a vacuum gap by applying the same transformation again,
this time not adding any new atoms (choose *"Do nothing"* in the prompt).
This is not strictly required by ViPErLEED, but makes it easier to recognize
which layer is our surface.

Our starting POSCAR file contains 40 atoms in total, which corresponds to
4 repeat units (layers) of 4 Fe and 6 O atoms each.


PARAMETERS and VIBROCC
======================

As in the previous examples, we begin with a simple
:ref:`PARAMETERS file<parameters>`:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/PARAMETERS
   :language: console
   :caption: PARAMETERS

The settings concerning global parameters and the :ref:`VIBROCC file<vibrocc>`
have been discussed in detail elsewhere (see e.g. :ref:`here<example_ag_100>`).
Note, however, the parameters concerning the structure interpretation.
To let ViPErLEED know what we consider the bulk structure, we generally need to
define the parameters :ref:`BULK_REPEAT`, :ref:`LAYER_CUTS<layer_cuts>`
and :ref:`N_BULK_LAYERS<n_bulk_layers>`.
Alternatively, as is done here, we could also specify the parameter
:ref:`BULK_LIKE_BELOW` with a suitable value (0.35 for the given POSCAR file).

We also use the :ref:`SITE_DEF<sitedef>` parameter to define which sites should
be treated separately by ViPErLEED.
In this case, we declare two ``surface`` sites each for iron and oxygen. This
will assign the two topmost atoms of each species to the surface, and treat
them as different sites in the calculation.
They will thus be assigned different electron-atom scattering phaseshifts (see
file :ref:`PHASESHIFTS`) and different vibrational amplitudes.


Initial vibrational amplitudes can be calculated based on the sample's Debye
temperature with the parameters :ref:`T_DEBYE`, :ref:`T_EXPERIMENT` and
:ref:`VIBR_AMP_SCALE<vibr_amp_scale>`. Instead, you can also provide the
amplitudes directly in the :ref:`VIBROCC file<vibrocc>`:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/VIBROCC
   :language: console
   :caption: VIBROCC


Note also that we set the :ref:`BEAM_INCIDENCE parameter<beamincidence>` to
:math:`\phi=90°` to match our input structure with the crystal orientation used
in the experiment.
This setting won't have any effect initially, since the azimuthal angle is set
:math:`\theta = 0°`.
However, we will optimize :math:`\theta` later on, at which point the value of
:math:`\phi` will be important.

Initialization
==============

We can now run the initialization to check if all input files are interpreted
correctly. If so, the :ref:`log<log_files_calc>` should look similar to this:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/log_init.txt
   :language: console
   :caption: Initialization log

The initialization log shows that the input files are interpreted correctly and
that the right plane group (``pg[0 1]``) is detected.
It also shows that the bulk structure and repeat vector have been identified.
This is reflected in the PARAMETERS file, which was updated in-place and should
now contain the following lines:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/PARAMETERS_bulk_detected
   :language: console
   :caption: PARAMETERS after initialization

The detected layers and bulk repeat vector are also shown in
:numref:`fig_Fe2O3_layers` for clarity.

.. _fig_Fe2O3_layers:
.. figure:: /_static/paper_figures/Hematite-Layers_embedded.svg
   :width: 60%
   :align: center

   Visualization of the crystal structure with highlighted layers, and the bulk
   repeat vector. This figure is taken from the ViPErLEED paper
   (TODO: add reference).


At this stage, before proceeding, you should always double-check the detected
bulk structure and spacing, as it is crucial for the calculation.
To help with this, ViPErLEED provides the files
:ref:`POSCAR_bulk and POSCAR_bulk_appended<poscar_bulk>`.
The former contains the crystal bulk structure as detected by ViPErLEED, and
the latter contains the surface slab with additional bulk layers appended to
it.
You can visualize these files in VESTA to check if the bulk structure is as you
expect.
In particular, one should make sure that the bulk stoichiometry for
POSCAR_bulk, and the bulk layer spacing for POSCAR_bulk_appended, are correct.

Reference calculation and structure optimization
================================================

If the initialization ran without errors, we can proceed to the reference
calculation and structure optimization. You can find more details about
what happens in each section of a ViPErLEED |LEED-IV| calculation
:ref:`here<work-segments>`.

In short, the :ref:`reference calculation<ref-calc>` performs a full-dynamic
LEED calculation to generate |IV| curves for the input structure. |IV| curves
are very sensitive to the exact atomic positions and vibrational amplitudes.
Because of this, it is generally necessary to optimize the structure to get
the best fit to the experimental |IV| data. The reference calculation is the
starting point for this optimization, but full-dynamic calculations are
computationally too expensive for the optimization which may require a very
large number of iterations.
We can perform the optimization in a computationally more efficient way by
using a perturbative approach, where we calculate the effect of small changes
to the input structure.
This is done in the :ref:`delta-amplitudes calculation<sec_deltas>` and
:ref:`structure optimization<sec_search>`.

To run these sections, we also need to specify which parameters we want to vary
(i.e. the parameter space).
We do this by providing a :ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<displacements>`:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/DISPLACEMENTS_L1-2_looped
   :language: console
   :caption: DISPLACEMENTS

Here, we specify that we want to optimize the atomic out-of-plane positions of
all atoms in the first and second layer from -0.05 to 0.05 Å in steps of 0.01 Å.
We optimize the vibrational amplitudes of the surface atoms in the same way.
We subsequently optimize in-plane position of the first two layers.
Note also the ``<loop>`` and ``</loop>`` tags at the beginning and end of the
file, which indicate that these steps should be repeated until convergence.
For more details on the syntax, see the page on the
:ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<displacements>`.


We can now start the calculation by setting the :ref:`RUN` parameter to
``1-3 1`` and starting the program.
This will execute the reference calculation, the Delta-Amplitude calculation
and the looped structure optimization in order.
By appending the ``1`` to the ``1-3``, we also tell ViPErLEED to finish with a
second reference calculation of the optimized structure.

Once finished, you can check the log files to see if the calculation ran
without errors.
You can also find the final |R factor| at the end of the log file:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/log_search_1.txt
   :language: console
   :caption: Final log

You may notice that the initial |R factor| (\ :math:`R_\mathrm{P}\approx0.78`)
is very high. This is not unusual when starting from a totally un-relaxed
bulk-truncated structure, as these may require multiple iterations of
reference calculations, and structure optimizations to converge.

.. _fig_Fe2O3_search_progress_1:
.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/figures/Search-report-first_optimization.svg
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

   Upper half of page 1 for ``Search-progress.pdf``.


.. note::

   You may also notice that the |R factor| for the second reference calculation
   is quite different from the |R factor| obtained at the end of the structure
   optimization. This is to be expected, as the perturbative tensor LEED
   approximation used in the structure optimization is only valid for small
   changes to the structure.
   The final reference calculation removes this error and gives a more accurate
   |R factor|.


Optimizing the incidence angle
==============================

In our case, the |R factor| has improved significantly after the
first structure optimization, but is still far from a good fit at
:math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.40`. This is because our measurement
was performed on a UHV manipulator that does not have enough degrees
of freedom in rotation to perfectly align the sample with the LEED optics.
We thus know that we need to optimize the incidence angle of the electron beam
to get a closer correspondence between the experimental and calculated |IV|
curves.

The incidence angle is not a parameter that is accessible in the tensor
LEED approximation.
In ViPErLEED, we can instead optimize the incidence angle using a
full-dynamic optimization, which optimizes a parameter by performing
a full-dynamic reference calculation at each iteration.

To do this, we need to edit PARAMETERS to set the :ref:`RUN` as ``6`` provide
the ``OPTIMIZE`` parameter to specify which parameter we want to optimize:

.. literalinclude :: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/PARAMETERS_optimize_theta
   :language: console
   :caption: PARAMETERS with OPTIMIZE specified for the incidence angle theta

Here, we set the initial step size to 1° and converge criterion to 0.1°.
After running the calculation, we find a minimum at about
:math:`\theta \approx 0.87°` which already reduces the |R factor| to about
:math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.22`. We can also see that the |IV| curves, and
consequently the |R factor|, are very sensitive to the incidence angle in the
:ref:`FD_Optimization.pdf<fdoptimizationbeams>` and
:ref:`FD_Optimization_beams.pdf<fdoptimizationbeams>` files (see
:numref:`fig_Fe2O3_fd_opt_theta_values` and
:numref:`fig_Fe2O3_fd_opt_theta_beams`).

.. _fig_Fe2O3_fd_opt_theta_values:
.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/figures/FD_Optimization.svg
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

   |R factor| as a function of the incidence angle as shown in
   :ref:`FD_Optimization.pdf<fdoptimizationbeams>`.


.. _fig_Fe2O3_fd_opt_theta_beams:
.. figure:: /_static/example_systems/Fe2O3(012)-(1x1)/figures/FD_Optimization_beam_(1,1).svg
   :width: 70%
   :align: center

   |IV| curves for beam (1|1) as shown in
   :ref:`FD_Optimization_beams.pdf<fdoptimizationbeams>`.

.. note::

   If the incidence angle is off-normal, it is generally advisable to optimize
   it relatively early on, before performing structural optimization deeper
   into the surface.
   Otherwise, the error in the |IV| curves may incorrectly be compensated by
   moving the atoms relative to the incident beam, which will result in
   incorrect positions relative to the bulk. This becomes more likely if
   bulk-like layers contribute only weakly to the |IV| curves, i.e., when
   also optimizing layers far below the surface.


Refining the structure
======================

After optimizing the incidence angle, we can perform another structure
optimization to refine the structure. To do this, we again provide a
:ref:`DISPLACEMENTS file<displacements>` to specify the range of parameters
we want to optimize. We can then run the calculation by setting the
:ref:`RUN` parameter back to ``1-3 1``. Note also that we should now
remove or comment out the ``OPTIMIZE`` parameter, as the superfluous
parameter will raise a warning otherwise.

At this point, the best strategy to achieve the optimal fit is generally not
known *a priori*, and the process may involve some trial and error.
In particular, you may need to play around with multiple iterations
of coarse- and fine-grained structure optimizations, and possibly
also adjust the :ref:`convergence parameters<search_convergence>`.

In this case, we found that by first performing another looped structure
optimization for the first two layers (atoms ``* L1-2``), and then adding the
third layer atoms (atoms ``* L1-3``) to the optimization, we could reliably
further reduce the |R factor| to about :math:`R_\mathrm{P} \approx 0.16`. [#]_


.. [#] We found that optimizing all three layers right away with the default
       convergence parameters lead to the |R factor| getting stuck in a local
       minimum on at least one occasion.
