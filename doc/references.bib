  abstract = {The adsorption of oxygen on the unreconstructed Ir(100) surface is investigated by a combination of experimental and theoretical methods comprising low-energy electron diffraction (LEED), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and density-functional theory (DFT). Apart from the well-known (2\texttimes 1)-O phase, we find a new (3\texttimes 1)-O phase for temperatures below 180 K. Our DFT calculations predict these two phases to be the only fundamental ground states of the system in the coverage range up to 0.5 monolayers. An analysis of the phase transitions as a function of coverage reveals extended coexistence ranges between the clean surface and the 3\texttimes 1 phase, or between the 3\texttimes 1 and 2\texttimes 1 phases, respectively. As a function of temperature, both phases undergo order-disorder transitions at about 650 K for the 2\texttimes 1 phase and 180 K for the 3\texttimes 1 phase, the latter being only partially reversible. The complete ordering behavior can be consistently explained by the energetics of model defect structures calculated by DFT. The crystallographic structure of the phases is determined by full-dynamical LEED intensity analyses, yielding excellent agreement between experimental and calculated data sets (Pendry R-factors: RP{$\approx$}0.1). Oxygen was found to assume bridge sites always inducing significant relaxations within the substrate. The derived structural parameters coincide with the respective predictions from DFT on the picometer scale. It is also shown that remnants and precursor stages of the clean surface's reconstruction can only be detected through the application of real-space methods such as STM. The overarching objective of the present study is to demonstrate how precisely and accurately such an adsorption system can be investigated nowadays by using a concerted experimental and theoretical approach.},

  abstract = {Hematite ({$\alpha$}-Fe2O3) is one of the most investigated anode materials for photoelectrochemical water splitting. Its efficiency improves by doping with Ti, but the underlying mechanisms are not understood. One hurdle is separating the influence of doping on conductivity, surface states, and morphology, which all affect performance. To address this complexity, one needs well-defined model systems. We build such a model system by growing single-crystalline, atomically flat Ti-doped {$\alpha$}-Fe2O3(11̅02) films by pulsed laser deposition (PLD). We characterize their surfaces, combining in situ scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) with density functional theory (DFT), and reveal how dilute Ti impurities modify the atomic-scale structure of the surface as a function of the oxygen chemical potential and Ti content. Ti preferentially substitutes subsurface Fe and causes a local restructuring of the topmost surface layers. Based on the experimental quantification of Ti-induced surface modifications and the structural model we have established, we propose a strategy that can be used to separate the effects of Ti-induced modifications to the surface atomic and electronic structures and bulk conductivity on the reactivity of Ti-doped hematite.},

It combines the advantages of an efficient automated optimization scheme with rapid access to model intensity data by tensor LEED. The geometrical, chemical and thermal versions of the latter method are employed to calculate the diffraction amplitudes for structures deviating from a certain preselected reference by atomic shifts, chemical occupation of lattice sites and both isotropic and anisotropic atomic vibrations. The automated optimization of the theory-experiment fit results from a modified random sampling algorithm, which scales as N2.5 with N the number of parameters, turning out to be a good compromise between global and local search methods. Using simulated intensity spectra for the Ir(110)-(2 \texttimes{} 1) missing-row reconstructed surface as pseudo-experimental data, we test and demonstrate the reliability of the new procedure and its efficiency. Also, we successfully apply the algorithm to real experimental data of two different surface phases of FeAl(100) and to data of Mo0.95Re0.05(100)-c(2 \texttimes{} 2)-C as examples for multi-parameter fits.},

Two surface structures are stable under ultrahigh vacuum (UHV) conditions; a stoichiometric (1 \texttimes{} 1) surface can be prepared by annealing at 450 \textdegree C in {$\approx$}10\textendash 6 mbar O2, and a reduced (2 \texttimes{} 1) reconstruction is formed by UHV annealing at 540 \textdegree C. The (1 \texttimes{} 1) surface is close to an ideal bulk termination, and the undercoordinated surface Fe atoms reduce the surface bandgap by {$\approx$}0.2 eV with respect to the bulk. The work function is measured to be 5.7 {$\pm$} 0.2 eV, and the VBM is located 1.5 {$\pm$} 0.1 eV below EF. The images obtained from the (2 \texttimes{} 1) reconstruction cannot be reconciled with previously proposed models, and a new ``alternating trench'' structure is proposed based on an ordered removal of lattice oxygen atoms.

The initial conditions, hitherto unspecified, for the nonlinear second-order amplitude equation at the finite radius of a muffin-tin (MT) sphere are established by a semiconvergent method. This opens the possibility of using APR for the calculation of electron scattering phase shifts with a finite MT radius as well as with a large atomic radius, whereby the first wave node is phase of reference equal to a multiple of {$\pi$}, adding nothing to the phase shifts. Furthermore, APR is used for benchmarking wave functions obtained by ordinary differential equation integration of the Dirac equations up to high energy and high orbital quantum number. The present APR procedure is discussed with reference to earlier numerical methods. To complete the physical picture, the paper ends with a discussion on exchange-correlation dependent scattering potential in MT spheres of optimized radii, a crystal potential model whose dependence on radii and energy dependent inner potential has recently been corroborated by low energy electron diffraction in oxides with many atoms per unit cell.},

  abstract = {We explore the accuracy of chemical composition profiles of substitutionally disordered alloys determined experimentally by LEED (low-energy electron diffraction) I(E) analysis. We analyse experimental I(E) spectra of pure Rh(111) for its known chemical composition by comparing them to calculations assuming a substitutionally disordered PtxRh1-x alloy surface. The layer concentrations known to be 100\% Rh are reproduced with a maximum error of 8\% when the Pendry R-factor (RP) is employed. This error is considerably smaller than estimated by error bars derived from the variance of RP. We argue that the same accuracy can be expected for compositional depth profiles to be determined for alloys exhibiting weak chemical order and negligible lattice distortions such as PtxRh1-x.},
