ViPErLEED documentation
=======================


Welcome to the manual for :term:`ViPErLEED` and the :term:`Python` package :term:`tleedm`.
See the :ref:`Getting Started page<getting_started>`.

The ViPErLEED project is a set of :ref:`open-source<license>` tools that aims at drastically reducing the effort for a intensity [LEED-:math:`I(V)`] analysis, both on the computational and on the experimental side.

The package consists of:


    i.  Hardware and software for data acquisition.
    #.  Software for extracting :math:`I(V)` curves from the experimental data ("movies").
    #.  Software for calculation of :math:`I(V)` curves for a given structure and structure optimization, by minimizing the difference between the calculated and experimental :math:`I(V)` data.

For details please see the ViPErLEED publication series (**TODO**).
This manual primarily deals with part **iii**.

The goal of any :term:`LEED-I(V)` calculation is the calculation of energy-dependent electron-scattering amplitudes and intensities of diffracted beams.
These intensity curves, taken as a function of the primary beam energy, [often referred to as :math:`I(V)` curves or spectra] are very sensitive to the precise position and vibrational amplitudes of each atom in the surface unit cell.
For more details consult works that cover the basics of :term:`LEED` and :term:`LEED-I(V)`, e.g.
Chapter 4 in :cite:t:`fausterSurfacePhysicsFundamentals2020,fausterOberflachenphysikGrundlagenUnd2013` or the overview by :cite:t:`heinzElectronBasedMethods2013`.
In ViPErLEED, these calculations are performed by the TensErLEED manager :term:`tleedm`.
tleedm is a Python package that acts as a comprehensive wrapper and feature extension to the :term:`TensErLEED` program package.

TensErLEED is used for the calculation of diffraction intensities of surface slabs (see also :ref:`reference calculation<ref-calc>`) and structure optimization using the :ref:`tensor LEED approach<tensor_leed>`.
For computational details please have a look at the ViPErLEED paper (**TODO**) and the original work describing TensErLEED by Blum and Heinz :cite:p:`blumFastLEEDIntensity2001a`.
