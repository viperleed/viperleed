ViPErLEED documentation
=======================

Welcome to the documentation of :term:`ViPErLEED` and of the ``viperleed``
:term:`Python` package.
The ViPErLEED project comprises a set of :ref:`open-source<license>` tools that
aims at drastically reducing the effort for quantitative low-energy electron
diffraction [i.e., |LEED-IV|] on both experimental and computational fronts.

The ViPErLEED source code is hosted on
GitHub at `<https://github.com/viperleed>`__.

.. todo::
    See also the ViPErLEED publication series (LINKS).

:numref:`toc_figure` shows an overview of the tools provided by the ViPErLEED
project:

-  The :ref:`ViPErLEED hardware<hardware>`
      A set of hardware, firmware and control software for the easy
      acquisition of |LEED-IV| data with pre-existing LEED systems.
-  The :ref:`imagej_plugins`
      Software for extracting |IV| curves from the experimental data
      ("movies").
-  The :ref:`viperleed.calc package<viperleed_calc>`
      A Python package for the calculation of |IV| curves, quantitative
      analysis of :term:`LEED` data, and surface-structure optimization.

    HANDLING OF APPENDICES
    The next part is a bit ugly. Its purpose is to make only one \part
    in LaTeX named "Appendix" (see content/appendix.rst) and have its
    contents be "chapters". Using for latex the same definition as
    for the non-latex case would make each chapter of "Appendix" a
    part by itself, which is ugly. On the other hand, we really want
    the contents of the appendix to appear at the top level in the
    navigation bar in HTML.
