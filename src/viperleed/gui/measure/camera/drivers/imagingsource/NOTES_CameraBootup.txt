TODOs when connecting a camera:

1) set video format (sets also sink)
2) set relevant VCD properties

LIVE VIEW
At least on the window that opens via start_live(True) no frames come if the
mode is set to continuous (although they should).

NOTES FOR CALLBACK:
pointer passed does not really change very often. Better to take a COPY of
the data in the buffer! When snapping images in live mode, the pointer
addresses seem to alternate between only TWO possible values.
According to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30678020, pyqtSignal NEVER
copies instances.
