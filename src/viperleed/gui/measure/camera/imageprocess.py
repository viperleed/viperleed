"""Module imageprocess of viperleed.gui.measure.camera.

This module defines the ImageProcessor class that is used to process
single camera frames into a final image. The following processing
steps take place:
    (1) Summing frames
    (2) Application of a region of interest
    (3) Removal of bad pixels
    (4) Binning
    (5) Averaging (i.e., sum/counts)
Steps 2 and 4 are skipped if the camera supports them as a native
hardware feature; steps 1 and 5 are also skipped if the camera
supports frame averaging at the hardware level.

    Attributes
    ----------
    bad_pixels : BadPixels
        BadPixels object holding information about which of the camera
        pixels are bad and how to correct them.
    filename : str
        Name of the file to be saved to disk after processing is over.
        If not given, no image will be saved after processing. It must
        have a '.tiff' suffix.
    base_path : str, optional
        Path to which filename will be saved. If not given, the current
        directory is used.
    n_frames : int
        The number of frames to be averaged. The truth value of this
        attribute should be False if the camera handles frame averaging
        internally
    roi : Sequence
        Region of interest. Four elements: x_offset, y_offset, width,
        height. Offsets are with respect to the top-left corner. The
        truth value of this attribute should be False if the camera
        handles the ROI internally
    binning : int
        Binning factor. Binning is executed on a (binning x binning)
        mesh. If the size of frames is not a integer multiple of
        binning, the bottom-right pixels will be removed. The truth
        value of this attribute should be False if the camera handles
        binning internally
    frame_times : list
        List of frame-arrival times.
    camera : CameraABC
        The camera to which these image processing infos are related.
    energy : str or float, optional
        The current LEED energy used, in electron-volts. Only used for
        storing information.
    date_time : datetime, optional
        The datetime.now() object for the current image.
    comment : str, optional
        Any user comment that will be stored with the image (e.g.,
        sample surface, preparation details, etc.).
    count : int, optional
        This is used exclusively if filename contains "{__count__".
        It can be used to progressively number frames. It is used
        to produce a filename like follows:
        filename = filename.format(__count__=count)
