# i0_gain : V/uA in 0--10V range; mV/uA in 0--2.5V range
#     The value returned by the Arduino in the two ranges assumes
#     that (0--10V) 1uA produces 1V at the BNC, or (0--2.5V) 1mA
#     produces 1V at the BNC. This gain factor can be used to account
#     for other situations (e.g., a different resistor is used)
# thermocouple_type : one of the types (e.g., K) for which coefficients
#     are available in classes/thermocouple_coefficients.txt. This is
#     the quantity used to convert the thermoelectric voltage of a
#     thermocouple connected to CH1 of ADC1 (normally AUX), as well as
#     the cold-junction temperature measured by the LM35, into an actual
#     TEMPERATURE in degC.
