[energies]
# Settings of the energy ramp of the measurement
# ----------------------------------------------
# start_energy
#   The energy at which the energy calibration will start.
# delta_energy
#   The energy difference between two measurement steps.
# end_energy
#   The energy at which the energy calibration will end.
# min_energy
#   The minimum energy a calibration has to start at. This value will
#   overwrite start_energy in an energy calibration if start_energy is
#   smaller than min_energy. min_energy is used to avoid calibrating for
#   the inaccuracies of LEED units in the low energy range (a few
#   electronvolts).
# step_profile
#   Shape of the curve to be used to set the next energy. Can be
#   "abrupt", ("abrupt", ), ("linear", nsteps, duration), or a list of
#   (fraction, time, fraction, time, ...). In the latter case,
#   "fraction" is the fraction of delta_energy to be applied at each
#   intermediate step (fraction = 0 means previous energy, fraction = 1
#   means current energy). Also, fraction = 1 should not be explicitly
#   included as the last step (nor should its settle time), as this is
#   added automatically.

[devices]
# Contains the configuration files of connected controllers.

#   quantities the controller is supposed to measure as a tuple of str.
#   ('path to ctrl settings', ('quantity 1', 'quantity 2', ...))
# secondary_controllers
#   The measurement settings of the secondary controllers. Given as as a
#   tuple of tuples. Each tuple is associated with a secondary
#   controller and contains the path to the settings.ini as a str and
#   the quantities the controller is supposed to measure as a tuple of

[measurement_info]
# Non-performance related information about the measurement.
# ----------------------------------------------------------
# started
#   The time at which the measurement started.
# ended
#   The time at which the measurement was concluded.
# tag
#   A name tag that is appended to the end of the folder name of the
#   measurement once the measurement is concluded and saved. Stored here
#   so that following measurements with the same settings file keep the
#   same tag.
# comments
#   Additional comments added by the user.
# was_aborted
#   Whether the calibration was aborted or not. Only set during a
#   measurement to retain information on how the energy calibration was
#   concluded.
