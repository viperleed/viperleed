"""Module beamgen of viperleed.calc.files

Creates the BEAMLIST file for TensErLEED calculations.

Original version by Florian Kraushofer (2020) was a wrapper for
the Fortran beamgen script by Uli LÃ¶ffler et al. Complete refactor
by Alexander Imre (2023) that removes the dependency on the Fortran
script and instead accomplishes the same in python. This is more
flexible and allows for more accurate calculations.

    """Calculate and write the contents for file BEAMLIST.

    BEAMLIST contains a list of all diffraction beams that will be
    used for internal calculations (as opposed to IVBEAMS, which
    contains the beams to be output). The file lists the beams with
    indices as float values and a lower cutoff energy below which
    the beam is evanescent (i.e., does not leave the surface and
    has intensity 0). The used format is defined in make_beamlist_lines
    and dictated by TensErLEED and the legacy beamgen scripts that were
    used before. Note that BEAMLIST is not read directly by refcalc,
    but instead all input files for the refcalc are combined into one
    string (by collectFIN in iorefcalc.py) and then piped in.

    NB: The energies calculated here are slightly higher than those
    from beamgenv3 (and beamgen.v1.7) because we use *more accurate*
    values for unit conversions. The legacy code used these rounded
    values:
    HARTREE_TO_EV = 27.21
    BOHR_TO_ANGSTROM = 0.529
    Similarly, the list of included beams may be different for the same
    energy range, as the legacy code used rounded values and typecast a
    cutoff from float to int.

    In any case, this version should give more accurate energy values
    and be more generous in how many beams are considered.

def get_beam_scattering_subsets(beam_indices_raw):
    """Return beam scattering subsets and reduced indices for a list of beams.

    LEED diffraction beams are grouped into subsets for the computation
    of reflection/transmission matrices. In the full-dynamic scattering
    calculation (refcalc), one needs to consider that one beam can be
    scattered into another. However, this is only possible, if the
    beam wave-vectors are related by the *bulk* unit cell. I.e., beam
    (1/2, 0) can be scattered into (3/2, 0), but not into (1, 0).
    This property can be used in the refcalc to simplify calculations
    by making the reflection/transmission matrices block-diagonal.
    To enable this, we need to group the beams accordingly in BEAMLIST.

    This function takes a list of beams (as BeamIndex objects) and
    calculates reduced indices via h_red = h%1, k_red = k%1 (wrapping
    the beams back in the first Brillouin zone). It then takes a set
    of the reduced indices, to generate unique identifiers of the
    subsets. The first (and possibly only) subset contains, by
    definition, the integer beams, starting with (0|0).

    Parameters
    ----------
    beam_indices_raw : Sequence
        Beam indices in (h, k) form.

    Returns
    -------
