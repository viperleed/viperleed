class SurfaceSlab(BaseSlab):
    """A class representing a semi-infinite solid.

    Contains unit cell, element information and atom coordinates.
    Also has a variety of convenience functions for manipulating
    and updating the atoms. Slabs can be created from an ase.Atoms
    object using the `from_ase` class method. Another common way
    is using `viperleed.calc.files.poscar.read`.

    Attributes
    ----------
    ucell : np.array
        The unit cell as vectors a, b, c (columns)
    poscar_scaling : float
        The original scaling factor from POSCAR
    elements : tuple of str
        Element labels as read from POSCAR
    chemelem : set of str
        Chemical elements in the slab, including from `ELEMENT_MIX`
    n_per_elem : dict {str: int}
        The number of atoms per POSCAR element.
    atlist : AtomList
        List of all atoms in the slab.
    layers : tuple of Layer
        Each `layer` is a composite of sublayers, as in TensErLEED
    sublayers : tuple of SubLayer
        Each SubLayer contains atoms of equal element and Z coordinate
    sitelist : list of Sitetype
        List of distinct sites as Sitetype, storing information
        on vibration and concentration
    ucell_mod : list of tuples (str, numpy.ndarray)
        Stored modifications made to the unit cell; each is a tuple
        of (type, array), where type is 'lmul', 'rmul', 'add', or
        'c_shift'.
    topat_ori_z : float
        Stores the original position of the topmost atom in Cartesian
        coordinates
    celltype : str                                                              # TODO: would be nicer with an Enum
        Unit-cell shape as string. Values: 'oblique', 'rhombic',
        'rectangular', 'square', 'hexagonal'
    planegroup : str
        Symmetry group of the slab. May be reduced by the user
        relative to `foundplanegroup`.
    foundplanegroup : str
        Highest symmetry found. Doesn't get modified when user
        reduces symmetry manually.
    orisymplane : SymPlane
        Only stored if the `planegroup` is ambiguous as to which unit
        vector the symmetry plane at the origin is parallel to
    linklists : list of list of Atom
        List of lists of atoms which are linked by a symmetry operation
    displists : list of list of Atom
        List of lists of atoms which are displaced together. This
        differs from `linklists` in that while `linklists` stores
        the linking based on the current symmetry, the `displists`
        store actual displacement linking based on the symmetry set
        at the time the displacement is assigned.
    deltas_initialized : bool
        Set by Rparams.generateSearchPars
    preprocessed : bool
        True if the POSCAR that this slab was read from had the
        'Plane group = XY' comment in the header, indicating that
        it was processed by viperleed.calc before.
    symbaseslab : Slab or None
        Slab with the smallest in-plane unit-cell area that shows
        the full symmetry of the slab.
    bulkslab : Slab or None
        Slab object containing only bulk layers

        Parameters
        ----------
        rpars : Rparams
            The PARAMETERS  from which BULK_REPEAT is taken.
        n_cells : int
            The number of bulk unit cells to be added to the
            copy returned.

        Returns
        -------
        bulk_appended : Slab
            A copy of self with `n_cells` bulk cells added at the
            bottom.
        new_bulk_atoms : list
            The Atoms that were added to append the new bulk cells.

        ------
        MissingLayersError
            If this method is called before any layer was identified,
            or if none of the layers is labelled as bulk.
        SlabError
            If the bulk repeat vector would give an unreasonably small
            interlayer distance. This may mean that (1) there are too
            few layers (e.g., only one thick layer), or (2) the bulk
            was not identified correctly (e.g., wrong BULK_REPEAT).
        ValueError
            If `n_cells` is not a positive number.

        Note
        ----
        Layers in the `bulk_appended` slab retuned are re-labelled
        so that there are exactly `rpars.N_BULK_LAYERS` bulk layers
        at the bottom. This means that layers of this slab that are
        labelled as bulk are turned into non-bulk layers in the
        `bulk_appended` slab returned (as are atoms in those layers).
