Created: 2024-04-03
Author: Florian DÃ¶rr, Michele Riva

Defines the ArduinoCLI, ArduinoCLIInstaller, FirmwareArchiveUploader,
and FirmwareUploader classes that handle Arduino CLI and Arduino core
downloads and Arduino firmware upgrades.
The Arduino CLI is available from
https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli/releases
"""

# NOTES: best way to go to also rename Arduino Micro to ViPErLEED is
# to (1) create a copy of the boards.txt file that comes with the CLI
# AFTER installing the avr core (TODO: check where it is, see also the
# notex.txt file) -- call it boards.txt.ViPErLEED; (2) in boards.txt.ViPErLEED
# replace 'Arduino Micro' with 'ViPErLEED' (unless the file was already there)
# (3) rename boards.txt to boards.txt.bak, and boards.txt.ViPErLEED to
# boards.txt; (4) compile and upload; (5) undo no.3.
