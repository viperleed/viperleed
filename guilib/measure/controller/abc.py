        This method must be reimplemented in subclasses. The

        and other optional data needed by the serial interface
        and turn them into a message that can be sent via
        self.send_message(message, *other_messages).

        the energy that the electrons will have when exiting the

        it should call the measure_now function.

        Parameters
        ----------
        energy : float
            Nominal electron energy in electronvolts
        settle_time : integer
            Interval in milliseconds that the controller will wait
            before deeming the LEED optics stable at set energy.
        *more_steps : Number
            If given, it should be an even number of elements.
            Odd elements are energies, even ones settle-time intervals.
            Multiple steps can be executed quickly after each other.
            The last step will be the final energy that is set and
            should ensure stabilization of the electronics.
