        Parameters
        ----------
        basis : Sequence or numpy.ndarray
            Shape (2, 2). Basis vectors a and b of the lattice, with
            a == basis[0], b == basis[1]. The units are assumed to be
            Angstrom for real-space lattices, and 2*pi/Angstrom for
            reciprocal-space ones.
        space : {'real', 'reciprocal'}, optional
            Whether the lattice is a real- or reciprocal-space one.
            Default is 'real'.
        group : str or PlaneGroup or None, optional
            Plane group in Hermann-Mauguin notation. If None or
            not given, use PlaneGroup('p1'). Default is None.
        limit : int, optional
            Radius (in the same units as `basis`) used to limit the
            number of lattice points generated. Only lattice points
            closer to the origin than `limit` will be produced.

        # This is a discrete version of Gram-Schmidt's algorithm
        # to find orthogonal bases.

        #   - order vectors by norm, the shortest first
        #   - determine the projection of the second on
        #     the first, and calculate the nearest integer
        #   - subtract from the second the projection calculated above
        #   - check whether now the second is the smallest.
        #     If yes, repeat, otherwise finished.
