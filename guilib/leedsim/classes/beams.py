    This class is a processor for finding beams that are equivalent

    during instantiation.

    The beams given are combined into a new data structure that
    contains the overall beam equivalences, i.e., the equivalence
    of the incoherent superposition of beams (if any are superposed)

    Since the calculations are relatively slow, and the combinations
    are many, instances are cached within a hash table. The hash is
    computed such that it is unique for the geometry considered.
    This gives speedups of more than a factor 100 upon re-using an
    already calculated geometry.

    This class is intended only for internal use. It does the heavy
    lifting for calculating beam eaquivalnce in the LEEDSymDomains,
    LEEDStructDomains, and LEEDPattern classes.

        """Initialize LEEDEquivalentBeams.

        Parameters
        ----------
        domains : list
            list of LEEDEquivalentBeams or list of dict, but not
            mixed. When dictionaries are passed, each one should be
            {beam: set(beams equivalent to beam)} where each beam
            is a 2-tuple-like. When passing a single instance of
            LEEDEquivalentBeams for superposition, very little
            computation is done, but the keys 'overlap_domains'
            and 'extinct_domains' of the .indexed_beams property
            are the same as those of domains[0], i.e., they
            do not contain the domain_ids passed. The caller needs
            to fix this a fortiori.
        basis : array-like
            2x2 matrix of the bulk basis, with a, b = basis. This
            parameter is optional when domains is a list of
            LEEDEquivalentBeams, as it is extracted from domains.
            Used to compute the hash.
        extinct_lists : iterable, optional
            each element is an iterable of the beams that are fully
            extinct in each domain
        domain_ids : iterable or int, optional
            list of "names" for each of the domains passed
            (default=range(len(domains))). Used to compute the hash.
        denominators : iterable, optional
            list of denominators to be used for normalizing each of the
            beam indices passed (default=None). Passing this argument
            makes instantiation much slower the first time a new
            configuration is created. It should be used only when
            combining structures with differently sized unit cells.
            In all other cases, passing fractional indices or only
            numerators in domains and extinct_lists is faster. When
            all domains are a LEEDEquivalentBeams, denominators for
            those that .has_fractional_beams are ignored.
        superlattice : array-like, optional
            2x2 superlattice matrix or iterable of 2x2 superlattice
            matrices. Used exclusively to compute the hash. Hash cannot
            be computed without this. The value passed is ignored when
            all domains are LEEDEquivalentBeams, as it is automatically
            calculated.
        angle_key : str, optional
            can be one of {'norm', 'other', angles} where angles is one
            of the special azimuthal angles (i.e., parallel to
            mirror/glide planes). Used to compute the hash. Hash cannot
            be computed without this. The value passed is ignored when
            all domains are LEEDEquivalentBeams, as it is automatically
            calculated.
        caller : object, optional
            The instance that requested the initialization. Used for
            hashing.

        This is the core method of this class. It is run once at

        It takes a list of dictionaries of beam equivalences, one per
        domain, and combines them into a single dictionary containing
        the equivalence classes corresponding to the superposition of
        the domains.  This is stored into the __eq_beams_dict instance

        {beam: set(beams equivalent to beam)} where each beam has the
        same type as passed, and the equivalence set is the one after
        accounting for superposition.  The information in this class
        attribute is a bit redundant, as the 'values' in the

            by __sort_hk and self.__sort_energy, i.e., the beam
            groups will appear: (1) in increasing radial position
            (i.e., energy), and (ii) for beams of equal radial
            position, beams with larger h+k index within a group will
            appear first.  There is no criterion for sorting
            beam-equivalence groups one with respect to the other,

        This method can be used as the 'key' optional argument of
        list.sort() or sorted() to sort beams given as (h, k) indices
        in the iterable to be sorted with increasing radial distance
        from the (0, 0) beam.

        Parameters
        ----------
        list_of_equivalent_indices : iterable
            List of indices of beams in a beam-equivalence group.
            The method assumes that the indices passed represent
            beams that are equivalent to one another, i.e., they
            index reciprocal-space vectors which all have the same
            length.

        Returns
        -------
        float
            Length of reciprocal-space vector.

        ----------
        basis : iterable
            2x2 iterable of the bulk basis. Converted to a 2x2 tuple.
        superlattice : iterable
            Single superlattice matrix, or list of superlattice

            is a tuple, so that a hash can be built. Only one
            superlattice matrix per domain is needed.
        domain_ids : iterable
            List of hashable entries that identify the domains.
        angle_key : str
            Identifier that defines the geometry of the primary beam.
        **kwargs : dict
            Other parameters are ignored
