    """Perform a ViPErLEED calulation starting from an ase.Atoms object.
    
    This function is a core part of the API for ViPErLEED. It allows to run
    a calulation from an ASE-type object.  The ASE object which is expected
    to contain a simulation cell will be cut at a specified height fraction,
    transformed into a ViPErLEED Slab and written to a POSCAR file. The
    ViPErLEED calculation will then be executed on the given structure using
    the input files found either in inputs_path or exec_path. The type of
    calculation performed depends on the value of the RUN parameter in the
    PARAMETERS file. If RUN = 1, this ultimately yields reference electron
    scattering amplitudes and intensities. These are collected in CSV files
    which are returned as strings for further processing.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    exec_path: string
        Path where to execute the reference calculation. The directory needs
        to exist. Input files will be copied from inputs_path, if provided.
        Otherwise it is assumed that all input files are already in exec_path.
        Temporary files will be stored in a subdirectory called work.
    ase_object : ase.Atoms
        ASE-type object that contains the atoms for the slab to be used with
        ViPErLEED. This is expected to contain a simulation cell which will
        be cut as described below.
    inputs_path: string, optional
        Path to directory containing input files (PARAMETERS, VIBROCC, etc.)
        for ViPErLEED calculation. If provided, files will be copied from
        inputs_path to exec_path (overwriting existing files there!).
    cut_cell_c_fraction : float, default=0.4
        Where to cut the ase object cell (ViPErLEED expects the cell to have
        the surface at the "top" -- i.e., at high z coordinates, and bulk-like
        layers at the bottom). Cutting will be performed along the vector c
        AFTER all transformations (see uc_transformation_matrix) are applied.
        Only the part of the cell above (i.e., >=) this value will be
        kept and everything else will be discarded.
    uc_transformation_matrix : np.ndarray, optional
        3x3 array, can contain an arbitray orthogonal transforamtion (i.e.,
        a combination of mirroring and rotations) that will be applied to the
        cell. Default is None, i.e., no transformation. The transformation is
        applied BEFORE scaling, i.e., using the original unit cell.
        The transformation is described by an orthogonal transfomation matrix
        (O) which is applied to both the unit cell and all atomic positions.
        This transformation is essentially equivalent to a change of basis.
        The transformation of the unit cell (U) is of the form OUO^T. Atom
        positions (v, both fractional and cartesian) are transformed as Ov.
        This parameter can be used to switch indices, rotate the slab, etc..
        Make sure that vectors a & b do not have any components in z
        direction after transformation as this is not allowed and will raise
        an error.
    uc_scaling : float or list of floats, optional
        Scaling to be applied to the cell. Default is None, i.e., no scaling.
        Scaling will be applied AFTER the transformation, i.e. along the new
        unit cell vectors. This can be used to apply an isotropic scaling in
        all directions or to strech/compress along unit cell vectors in order
        to change lattice constants in some direction. If the scaling is given
        as a number or a 1-element sequence, an isotropic scaling will be
        applied to the unit cell and atom positions. If a sequence with 3
        entries is provided, the scaling will be applied along the unit cell
        vectors in the given order. Given uc_scaling == (s1, s2, s3), the
        new unit cell vectors will be a' = a * s1, b' = b * s2, c' = c * s3.

    Returns
    -------
    theobeams_file_str : string
        String containg the contents of the file "THEOBEAMS.csv", i.e. the
        scattering intensities as calculated in the reference calculation.
        An empty string is returned if no reference calculation was run.
    amp_real_file_str : string
        String containg the contents of the file "Complex_amplitudes_real.csv",
        i.e., the real part of the scattering amplitudes as calculated in the
        reference calculation. An empty string is returned if no reference
        calculation was run.
    amp_imag_file_str : string
        String containg the contents of the file "Complex_amplitudes_imag.csv",
        i.e., the imaginary part of the scattering amplitudes as calculated in
        the reference calculation. An empty string is returned if no reference
        calculation was run.
    v0i : float
        Imaginary part of the inner potential as read from "PARAMETERS". This is
        returned here since it is an input parameter for the R-factor calculation.
        The value is read from PARAMETERS and left unchanged - it is not a result
        of the calculation and is returned here for convenience only.
    
    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If exec_path is non-existent (or not a directory)
    RuntimeError
        If no PARAMETERS file was found in exec_path (after potentially
        copying over from inputs_path)
    RuntimeError
        If either of the first two unit cell vectors have a component
        perpendicular to the surface (i.e., along the z coordinate)
        after transformation of the unit cell
    
    Notes
    -------
    The parameter uc_transformation_matrix can be used to apply some useful
    transformations to the Slab object. Examples include swapping vectors b
    and c, rotations around an axis and flipping the cell along c (in case
    the lower part has to be kept, rather than the top one). For these standard
    applications, have a look at the matrices we provide as part of this module:
        switch_b_c_mat : Switches vectors b & c
        switch_a_b_mat : Switches vectors a & b
        flip_c_mat : Flips (i.e., mirrors) cell along c
        rot_mat_c(theta) : Returns a rotation matrix around c (by theta rad.)
        rot_mat_a(theta) : Returns a rotation matrix around a (by theta rad.)
    For applying multiple operations, the order does matter. You can combine
    operations via matrix multiplication (@ symbol or np.dot); the left-most
    matrix is applied last.

    ----------
    beams_files : tuple of two string
        The two CSV files to be read in for R-factor calculation.
        These can contain either theoretical or experimental beams.
        If beams_file_is_content is set as True, the string is expected
        to contain the contents of the CSV file, otherwise it should be
        a path to the file.
    v0i : float
        Imaginary part of the inner potential (in eV).
    beams_file_is_content : tuple of two bool, default=(False, False)
        If either value is set to True, it is assumed that the
        corresponding element of beams_file contains a string with
        the CSV contents rather than a path to the file. For reading,
        a StringIO will be used internally.
    v0r_shift_range : Sequence of two float, default=(-3, 3)
        During R-factor calculation, the two beam sets can be shifted
        in energy relative to one another. v0r_shift_range determines
        the minimum and maximum shifts (given in eV). The closest
        integer multiple of intpol_step will be used for the bounds.
    intpol_deg : int, default=5
        Either 3 or 5; degree of the interpolating spline polynomial
    intpol_step : float, default=0.5
        Step size of the energy grid the beam data will be interpolated
        on (in eV).
    return_beam_arrays : bool, default = False
        For debugging, you can optionally return the interpolated beams,
        y-functions, number of overlapping points & per-beam R-factors.
        
    Returns
    -------
    best_R : float
        The R-factor between the two files. Returns the best R factor
        found after variation in v0r_shift_range.
    best_v0r : float
        The v0r value for which the best R-factor was found.

    """Plots LEED-I(V) spectra directly from a CSV file.

    This function can be used to plot LEED-I(V) spectra directly from
    a CSV file without running any other calculations.
    It is assumed that the CSV file uses the format used by ViPErLEED.
    Returns nothing but writes the pdf file.


    Parameters
    ----------
    beam_file : string
        If beam_file_is_content is set as True, the string is expected
        to contain the contents of the CSV file, otherwise it should be
        a path to the file.
    beam_file_is_content : bool, default = False
        If set to True, it is assumed that the beam_file
        contains a string with the CSV contents rather than a path to
        the file. For reading, a StringIO will be used internally.
    output_pdf : pathlib Path, string or None; default = None
        Path to the PDF file where the plot will be saved, if Path or string.
        (File is created.) If None, returns list of matplotlib figures.
    which_beams : range or Sequence of int or strings
        Indices specifying which beams to plot. Order is the same as in the csv.
    legends : None or list of strings, default = None
        Legends to be used for the various files.

    Raises
